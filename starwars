"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...."

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the MAIN TITLE,
followed by a ROLL UP, which crawls up into infinity.

"EPISODE 1 THE PHANTOM MENACE"

"Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of
trade routes to outlaying star systems is in dispute.  Hoping
to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships,
the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the
small planet of Naboo.

While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this
alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly
dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace and
justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict....."

PAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA
at great speed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads towardthe
beautiful green planet of Naboo, which is surrounded by
hundreds of Trade Federation battleships.

INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT

In the cockpit of the cruise, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver
closer to one of the battleships.

		QUI-GON (O.S.)
	Captain.

The Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.

		CAPTAIN
	Yes, sir?

		QUI-GON (O.S.)
	Tell them we wish to board at once.

		CAPTAIN
	Yes, sir.

The CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a
Neimoidian trade viceroy, waits for a reply.

		CAPTAIN
	With all due respect for the Trade
	Federation, the Ambassadors for the
	Supreme Chancellor wish to board
	immediately.

		NUTE
	Yes, yes, of coarse...ahhh...as you
	know, our blockade is perfectly legal,
	and we'd be happy to recieve the
	Ambassador...Happy to.

The screen goes black. Out the cockpit window, the sinister
battleship looms ever closer.

EXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE (FX)

The small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of
the Federation battleship.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE

A PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking
bay. Two WORKER DROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9 watch.

		PK-4
	They must be important if the Viceroy
	sent one of those useless protocol
	gearheads to greet them.

The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the
docking bay.  Two darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.

		TC-14
	I'm TC-14 at your service. This way,
	please.

They move off down the hallway.

		EG-9
	A Republic cruiser! That's
	trouble...don't you think?

		PK-4
	I'm not made to think.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

A door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST
CAMERA into the formal conference room by TC-14.

		TC-14
	I hope you honoured sirs with the
	most comfortable here. My master
	will be with you shortly.

The droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He
backs out the door and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods
and look out a large window at the lush green planet of Naboo.
QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white hair in a ponytail.
He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is twenty
five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes.
Several exotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the
door.

		OBI-WAN
	I have a bad feeling about this.

		QUI-GON
	I don't sense anything.

		OBI-WAN
	It's not about the mission, Master,
	it's somethging...elsewhere...elusive.

		QUI-GON
	Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-
	Wan. Keep your concentration here
	and now where it belongs.

		OBI-WAN
	Master Yoda says I should be mindful
	of the future...

		QUI-GON
	...but not at the expense of the
	moment. Be mindful of the living
	Force, my young Padawan.

		OBI-WAN
	Yes, Master...how do you think the
	trade viceroy will deal with the
	chancellor's demands?

		QUI-GON
	These Federation types are cowards.
	The negotiations will be short.



INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE GUNRAY and DAULTRAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC-
14.

		NUTE
	     (shaken)
	What?!? What did you say?

		TC-14
	The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I
	believe.

		DOFINE
	I knew it! They were sent to force a
	settlement, eh. Blind me, we're done
	for!

		NUTE
	Stay calm?  I'll wager the Senate
	isn't aware of the Supreme
	Chancellor's moves here. Go. Distract
	them until I can contact Lord Sidious.

		DOFINE
	Are you brain dead? I'm not going in
	there with two Jedi! Send the droid.

Dofine turns to TC-14, who lets out a squeaky sigh.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

		OBI-WAN
	Is it their nature to make us wait
	this long?

The door to the conference room slides open, and TC-14 enters
with a tray of drinks and food.

		QUI-GON
	No. I sense an unusual amount of
	fear for something as trivial as
	this dispute.

Obi-Wan takes a drink.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

Nute, Dofine, and Rune Haako are before the hologram of Darth
Sidious, a robed figure whose face is obscured by a hood.

		DOFINE
	This scheme of yours has failed,
	Lord Sidious. The blockade is
	finished! We dare not go against
	these Jedi.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	You seem more worried about the Jedi
	than you are of me, Dofine. I am
	amused.. Viceroy!

Nute, looking very nervous, steps forward.

		NUTE
	Yes, My lord.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	I don't want that stunted slime in
	my sight again. Do you understand?

		NUTE
	Yes, My Lord.

Nute gives Dofine a fierce look, and Dofine, terrified, rushed
off the bridge.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	This turns of events is unfortunate.
	We must accelerate our plans, Viceroy.
	Begin landing your troops.

		NUTE
	Ahh, My Lord, is that, Legal?

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	I will make it legal.

		NUTE
	And, the Jedi??

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	The Chancellor should never have
	brought them into this. Kill them,
	immediatly.

		NUTE
	Ye..Yes, My Lord. As you wish.

INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT - DOCKING BAY

In the Cockpit of the Cruiser, the Captain and Pilot look up
and see a gun turret swing around and point directly at them.

		PILOT
	Captain !? Look !!

		CAPTAIN
	No! Warn...

EXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HANGER BAY

The battle gun fires. The Republic Cruiser explodes.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

Gui-Gon and Obi-Wan leap up to a standing position with their
light sabers drawn. TC-14 jumps back, startled, spilling the
drinks tray.

		TC-14
	Ahhh, Sorry, sir. The Viceroy...

Gui-Gon and Obi-Wan turn off their swords and listen intently.
A faint hissing sound can be heard.

		GUI-GON
	Gas!

Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan each taken a sudden deep breath and
holding it.  The exotic bird-like creatures in the cage dorp
dead.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY

A hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in
the conference room hallway.

		NUTE
	They must be dead by now. Blast,
	what's left of them.

The hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously
opens the door. A deadly green cloud billows from the room.
BATTLE DROIDS cock their weapons as a figure stumbles out of
the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the tray of drinks.

		TC-14
	Oh, excuse me, so sorry.

The PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing
laser swords fly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several
BATTLE DROIDS before they can fire.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The bridge is a cocophony of alarms. NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-
1 on the viewscreen.

		OWO-1
	Not sure exactly what...

OWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. RUNE gives
NUTE a worried look.

		NUTE
	What in blazes is going on down there?

		RUNE
	Have you ever encountered a Jedi
	Knight before, sir?

		NUTE
	Well, not exactly, but I don't...
	     (panicked)
	Seal off the bridge.

		RUNE
	That won't be enough, sir.

The doors to the bridge SLAM shut.

		NUTE
	I want destroyer droids up here at
	once!!!

		RUNE
	We will not survive this.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

QUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower
of sparks and metal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending
several BATTLE DROIDS crashing into the wall.

QUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut
through it.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the
bridge door.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.

		NUTE
	Close the blast doors!!!

The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a
second door, then a third. There is a hissing sound as the
huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs the door with his sword.
The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the center of
the blast door.

		RUNE
	...They're still coming through!

On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.

		NUTE
	Impossible!! This is impossible!!

		RUNE
	Where are those destroyer droids?!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

Ten ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at
full speed. Just before they get to the bridge area, they
stop and transform into their battle configuration. QUI-GON
can't see them but senses their presence.

		QUI-GON
	Destroyer droids!

		OBI-WAN
	Offhand, I'd say this mission is
	past the negotiaion stage.

The WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three
hallways, blasting away with their laser guns. They stop
firing and stand in a semi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-
WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be seen.

		P-59
	Switch to bio...There they are!

The Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash
through the doorway that slams shut. The WHEEL DROIDS blast
away at the two JEDI with their laser swords.

		OBI-WAN
	They have shield generators!

		QUI-GON
	It's a standoff! Let's go!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen
as the WHEEL

DROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway.

		RUNE
	We have them on the run, sir...they're
	no match for destroyer droids.

		TEY HOW
	Sir, they've gone up the ventilation
	shaft.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger
bay. They are careful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE
DROIDS are loading onto landing craft.

		QUI-GON
	Battle droids.

		OBI-WAN
	It's an invisible army.

		QUI-GON
	It's an odd play for the Trade
	Federation. We've got to warn the
	Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum.
	Let's split up. Stow aboard separate
	ships and meet down on the planet.

		OBI-WAN
	You were right about one thing,
	Master. The negotiations were short.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW recieves a transmission.

		TEY HOW
	Sir, a transmission from the planet.

		RUNE
	It's Queen Amidala herself.

		NUTE
	At last we're getting results.

On the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room.
Wearing her elaborate headdress and robes, she sits,
surrounded by the GOVERNING COUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS,
EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.

		NUTE
	Again you come before me, Your
	highness. The Federation is
	pleased.

		AMIDALA
	You will not be pleased when you
	hear what I have to say,
	Viceroy...Your trade boycott of our
	planet has ended.

NUTE smirks at RUNE.

		NUTE
	I was not aware of such a failure.

		AMIDALA
	I have word that the Senate is finally
	voting on this blockade of yours.

		NUTE
	I take it you know the outcome. I
	wonder why they bother to vote.

		AMIDALA
	Enough of this pretense, Viceroy!
	I'm aware the Chancellor's Ambassadors
	are with you now, and that you have
	beencommanded to reach a settlement.

		NUTE
	I know nothing about any
	Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.

AMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.

		AMIDALA
	Beware, Viceroy....the Federation is
	going too far this time.

		NUTE
	Your Highness, we would never do
	anything without the approval of the
	Senate. You assume too much.

		AMIDALA
	We will see.

The QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.

		RUNE
	She's right, the Senate will never....

		NUTE
	It's too late now.

		RUNE
	Do you think she suspects an attack?

		NUTE
	I don't know, but we must move quickly
	to disrupt all communications down
	there.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM

The QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand
before a hologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.

		PALPATINE
	...How could that be true? I have
	assurances from the Chancellor...his
	Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be
	the...get...negotiate...

The hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away.

		AMIDALA
	Senator Palpatine?!?
	     (turns to Panaka)
	What's happening?

Capt. Panaka turns to his SARGEANT.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Check the transmission generators...

		BIBBLE
	A malfunction?

		CAPT. PANAKA
	It could be the Federation jamming
	us. Your Highness.

		BIBBLE
	A communications disruption can only
	mean one thing. Invasion.

		AMIDALA
	Don't jump to conclusions, Governor.
	The Federation would not dare go
	that far.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	The Senate would revoke their trade
	franchise, and they'd be finished.

		AMIDALA
	We must continue to rely on
	negotiation.

		BIBBLE
	Negotiation? We've lost all
	communications!...and where atre the
	Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we
	negotiate? We must prepare to defend
	ourselves.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	This is a dangerous situation, Your
	Highness.  Our security volunteers
	will be no match against a battle-
	hardened Federation army.

		AMIDALA
	I will not condone a course of action
	that will lead us to war.

EXT. SPACE LANDING CRAFT - TWILIGHT (FX)

Six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the
planet Naboo.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - SHALLOW LAKE - TWILIGHT

Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover
of the perpetually gray twilight side of the planet. One by
one, the Federation warships land in the eerie swamp.  OBI-
WAN's head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake. For in
the background, the activities of the invasion force can be
seen in the mist.

OBI-WAN takes several deep breaths, then dissapears again
under the muddy swamp. Troop Transports (MTT's) emerge from
the landing craft.

EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP / GRASS PLAINS - TWILIGHT (FX)

The droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a
grassy plain.

OOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching
across the rolling hills. A small hologram of RUNE and NUTE
stands on the tank.

		RUNE
	...and there is no trace of the Jedi.
	They may have gotton onto one of
	your landing craft.

		OOM-9
	If they are down here, sir, we'll
	find them.  We are moving out of the
	swamp and are marching on the cities.
	We are meeting no resistance.

		NUTE
	Excellent.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to
see the monstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist.
Animals begin to run past him in a panic.

An odd, frog-like Gungan, JAR JAR INKS, squats holding a
clam he has retrieved from the murky swamp.  The shell pops
open. JAR JAR's greta tongue snaps out and grabs the clam,
swallowing it in one gulp.

JAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures
running like the wind toward him. One of the huge MTT's bears
down on the JEDI like a charging locomotive. JAR JAR stands
transfixed, still holding the clam shell in one hand.

		JAR JAR
	Oh, noooooooooo!

JAR JAR drops the shell and grabs onto QUI-GON as he passes.
The JEDI is caught by surprise.

		JAR JAR
	Hey, help me! Help me!!

		QUI-GON
	Let go!

The machine is about tp crush them as QUI-GON drags JAR JAR
behind him.  Just as the transport is about to hit them, QUI-
GON drops, and JAR JAR goes splat into the mud with him. The
transport races overhead.

QUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They
stand watching the war machine dissapear into the mist. JAR
JAR grabs QUI-GON and hugs him.

		JAR JAR
	Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!

The frog-like creature kisses the JEDI.

		QUI-GON
	Are you brainless? You almost got us
	killed!

		JAR JAR
	I spake.

		QUI-GON
	The ability to speak does not make
	you intelligent. Now get outta here!

QUI-GON starts to move off, and JAR JAR follows.

		JAR JAR
	No...no! Mesa stay...Mesa yous humble
	servaunt.

		QUI-GON
	That wont be necessary.

		JAR JAR
	Oh boot tis! Tis demunded byda guds.
	Tis a live debett, tis. Mesa culled
	Jaja Binkss.

In the distance, two STAPS burst out of the mist at high
speed, chasing OBI-WAN.

		QUI-GON
	I have no time for this now...

		JAR JAR
	Say what?

The two STAPS barrell down on OBI-WAN.

		JAR JAR
	Oh, nooooo! Weesa ganna....

QUI-GON throws JAR JAR into the mud.

		QUI-GON
	Stay down!

His head pops up.

		JAR JAR
	...dieeee!

The two troops fire laser bolts at OBI-WAN. QUI-GON deflects
the bolts back, and the STAPS blow up. One-two. OBI-WAN is
exhausted and tries to catch his breath.

		OBI-WAN
	Sorry, Master, the water fried my
	weapon.

OBI-WAN pulls out his burnt laser sword handle. QUI-GON
inspects it, as JAR JAR pulls himself out of the mud.

		QUI-GON
	You forgot to turn your power off
	again, didn't you?

OBI-WAN nods sheeplishly.

		QUI-GON
	It won't take long to recharge, but
	this is a lesson I hope you've
	learned, my young Padawan.

		OBI-WAN
	Yes, Master.

		JAR JAR
	Yousa sav-ed my again, hey?

		OBI-WAN
	What's this?

		QUI-GON
	A local. Let's go, before more of
	those droids show up.

		JAR JAR
	Mure? Mure did you spake??!?

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON start to run. JAR JAR tries to keep up.

		JAR JAR
	Ex-squeeze me, but da moto grande
	safe place would be Otoh Gunga. Tis
	where I grew up...Tis safe city.

They all stop.

		QUI-GON
	A city!
	     (JAR JAR nods his
	     head)
	Can you take us there?

		JAR JAR
	Ahhh, will...on second taut...no,
	not willy.

		QUI-GON
	No??!

		JAR JAR
	Iss embarrissing, boot... My afrai
	my've bean banished. My forgoten der
	Bosses would do terrible tings to
	my. Terrible tings if my goen back
	dare.

A PULSATING SOUND is heard in the distance.

		QUI-GON
	You hear that?

JAR JAR shakes his head yes.

		QUI-GON
	That's the sound of a thousand
	terrible things heading this way...

		OBI-WAN
	When they find us, they will crush
	us, grind us into little pieces,
	then blast us into oblivion!

		JAR JAR
	Oh! Yousa point is well seen. Dis
	way! Hurry!

JAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop
as JAR JAR tries to catch his breath.  The TRANSPORTS ARE
HEARD in the distance.

		QUI-GON
	Much farther?

		JAR JAR
	Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility
belts that turn into breathing masks.

		JAR JAR
	My warning yous. Gungans no liken
	outlaunders. Don't expict a wern
	welcome.

		OBI-WAN
	Don't worry, this has not been our
	day for warm welcomes.

JAR JAR jumps, does a double somersault with a twist, and
dives into the water.

Breath masks on, QUI-GON and OBI-WAN wade in after him.

EXT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at
home in the water. Down they swim into murky depths. In the
distance the glow of Otoh Gunga, an underwater city made up
of large bubbles, becomes more distinct.

They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. JAR JAR swims
magically through one of the bubble membranes, which seals
behind him. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON follow.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE

GUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI.
Four GUARDS armed with long electro-poles ride two-legged
KAADUS into the square. The GUARDS, led by CAPTAIN TARPALS,
point their lethal poles at the dripping trio.

		JAR JAR
	Heyo-dalee, Cap'n Tarpals, Mesa back!

		CAPT. TARPALS
	Noah gain, Jar Jar. Yousa goen tada
	Bosses. Yousa in big dudu this time.

CAPT. TARPALS gives JAR JAR a slight zap with his power pole.
JAR JAR jumps and moves off, followed by the two JEDI.

		JAR JAR
	How wude.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - HIGH TOWER BOARD ROOM

The Bosses' Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted
fish swimming around outside like moving stars.  A long
circular judge's bench filled with GUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates
the room. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand facing BOSS NASS, who
sits on a bench higher than the others.

		BOSS NASS
	Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of
	mackineeks up dare tis new weesong!

		QUI-GON
	That droid army is about to attack
	the Naboo. We must warn them.

		BOSS NASS
	Wesa no like da Naboo! Un dey no
	like uss-ens. Da Naboo tink day so
	smarty den us-ens. Day tink day brains
	so big.

		OBI-WAN
	After those droids take control of
	the surface, they will come here and
	take control of you.

		BOSS NASS
	No, mesa no tink so. Mesa scant talkie
	witda Naboo, and no nutten talkie it

		OBI-WAN
	You and the Naboo form a symbiont
	circle.  What happens to noe of you
	will affect the other. You must
	understand this.

		BOSS NASS
	Wesa wish no nutten in yousa tings,
	outlaunder, and wesa no care-n about

		QUI-GON

	Then speed us on our way.

	We need a transport.

		BOSS NASS
	Wesa give yousa una bongo. Da speedest
	way tooda Naboo tis goen through da

		QUI-GON
	Thank you for your help. We go in
	peace.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn to leave.

		OBI-WAN
	Master, whats a bongo?

		QUI-GON
	A transport, I hope.

The JEDI notice JAR JAR in chains to one side, waiting to
hear his verdict.

QUI-GON stops. JAR JAR gives him a forlorn look.

		JAR JAR
	Daza setten yous up. Goen through da
	planet core is bad bombin!!

		QUI-GON
	Thank you, my friend.

		JAR JAR
	Ahhh...any hep hair would be hot.

JAR JAR's soulful look is counterpointed by a sheepish grin.

		OBI-WAN
	We are short of time, Master.

		QUI-GON
	We'll need a navigator to get us
	through the planet's core. This Gungan
	my be of help.

QUI-GON walks bact to BOSS NASS.

		QUI-GON
	What is to become of Jar Jar Binks
	here?

		BOSS NASS
	Binkss brokeen the nocombackie law.
	Hisen to be pune-ished.

		QUI-GON
	He has been a great help to us. I
	hope the punishment will not be too
	severe.

		BOSS NASS
	Pounded unto death.

		JAR JAR
	     (grimacing)
	Oooooh...Ouch!

OBI-WAN looks concerned. QUI-GON is thinking.

		QUI-GON
	We need a navigator to get us through
	the planet's core. I have saved Jar
	Jar Binks' life. He owes me what you
	call a "life debt."

		BOSS NASS
	Binks. Yousa havena liveplay with
	thisen hisen?

JAR JAR nods and joins the JEDI. QUI-GON waves his hand.

		QUI-GON
	Your gods demand that his life belongs
	to me now.

		BOSS NASS
	Hisen live tis yos, outlauder. Begone
	wit him.

		JAR JAR
	Count mesa outta dis! Better dead

EXT. NABOO CITY - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

A strange little submarine propels itself away from the Otoh
Gunga, leaving the glow of the settlement in the distance.

INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

OBI-WAN in the co-pilots seat, JAR JAR guides the craft.

		JAR JAR
	Dis is nusen.

		OBI-WAN
	Master, why do you keep dragging
	these pathetic life forms along with
	us?...Here, take over.

		JAR JAR
	Hey, ho? Where wesa goen??

		QUI-GON
	You're the navigator.

	Yo dreamen mesa hopen...

		QUI-GON
	Just relax, the Force will guide
	us...

		JAR JAR
	Ooooh, maxibig..."da Force"...Wellen,
	dat smells stinkowiff.

JAR JAR veers the craft to the left and turns the lights on.
The coral vistas are grand, fantastic, and wonderous.

		OBI-WAN
	Why were you banished, Jar Jar?

		JAR JAR
	Tis a long tale, buta small part
	wawdabe mesa... ooooh... aaaa...
	clumsy.

		OBI-WAN
	They banished you because you're
	clumsy?

As the little sub glides into the planet core, a large dark

		JAR JAR
	Mesa cause-ed mabee one or duey lettal
	bitty axadentes...yud-say boom da
	gasser, un crash Der Bosses
	heyblibber...den banished.

Suddenly there is a loud CRASH, and the little craft lurches
to one side.

QUI-GON looks around and sees a huge, lumimnous OPEE SEA
KILLER has hooked them with its long gooey tongue.

		QUI-GON
	Full speed ahead.

Instead of full ahead, JAR JAR jams the controls into reverse.
The sub flies into the mouth of the creature.

		JAR JAR
	Oooops.

		OBI-WAN
	Give me the controls.

OBI-WAN takes over the controls and the OPEE SEA KILLER
instantly releases the sub from its mouth.

		JAR JAR
	Wesa free!

As the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws, munching
on the hapless KILLER. The jaws belong to the incredible
SANDO AQUA MONSTER. The lights on the tiny sub begin to
flicker as they cruise deeper into the gloom.

		QUI-GON
	There's always a bigger fish.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

		NUTE
	The invasion is on schedule, My Lord.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	Good. I have the Senate bogged down
	in procedures. By the time this
	incident comes up for a vote, they
	will have no choice but to accept
	your control of the system.

		NUTE
	The Queen has great faith the Senate
	will side with her.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	Queen Amidala is yound and naive.
	You will find controlling her will
	not be difficult. You have done well,
	Viceroy.

		NUTE
	Thank you, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades away.

		RUNE
	You didn't tell him about the missing
	Jedi?

		NUTE
	No need to report that to him, until
	we have something to report.

INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

Sparks are flying, and water is leaking into the cabin. The
sound of the power drive drops.

		OBI-WAN
	...we're losing power.

OBI-WAN is working with the sparking wires. JAR JAR panics.

		QUI-GON
	Stay calm. We're not in trouble yet.

		JAR JAR
	What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak'n
	in here, all'n sink'n, and nooooo
	power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINK
	WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!?

		OBI-WAN
	Power's back.

The lights flicker on, revealing an ugly COLO CLAW FISH right
in front of them.

		JAR JAR
	Monstairs back!

The large COLO CLAW FISH is surprised and rears back. The
sub turns around and speeds away.

		JAR JAR
	Wesa in trouble now??

		QUI-GON
	Relax.

QUI-GON puts his hand on JAR JAR's shoulder. JAR JAR relaxes
into a coma.

		OBI-WAN
	You overdid it.

The COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots
out of the tunnel and into the waiting jaws of the SANDO
AQUA MONSTER.

		OBI-WAN
	This is not good!

JAR JAR regains consciousness.

		JAR JAR
	Wesa dead yet?? Oie Boie!

JAR JAR's eyes bulge, and he faints again. The sub narrowly
avoids the deadly teeth of the AQUA MONSTER. The COLO CLAW
FISH chasing them isn't so lucky. It is munched in half by
the larger predator. The little sub slips away.

		QUI-GON
	Head for that outcropping.

EXT. THEED - MAIN ROAD INTO THEED - DAY (FX)

The long columns of the DROID ARMY move down the main road
leading to Theed, the Naboo capital.

EXT. THEED PLAZA - DAY (FX)

As the QUEEN watches helplessly from a window in the palace,
a transport carrying NUTE and RUNE lands in Theed Plaza.
They exit the transport.

		NUTE
	Ah, victory!

INT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

The little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface,
which is brightly lit.

		JAR JAR
	Wesa dude it!

EXT. THEED - ESTUARY - DAY

Paradise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water.
There is a LOUD RUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the
surface.

The current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward
into a fast moving river. OBI-WAN switches off the two
remaining bubble canopies.

QUI-GON stands up to look around. JAR JAR lets out a sigh of
relief.

		JAR JAR
	Wesa safe now.

		QUI-GON
	Get this thing started.

		JAR JAR
	Dissen berry good. Hey?

		OBI-WAN
	What is it?

JAR JAR looks back to where they're drifting. He sees they
are headed for a huge waterfall.

		JAR JAR
	What!!?? Oie boie!

OBI-WAN tries to start the engine. The long props behind the
sub slowly begin to rotate. OBI-WAN struggles until finally,
a few feet short of the waterfall, the sub starts and is
able to generate enough power to stop drifting backward in
the powerful current. The sub slowly moves forward. In the
background, QUI-GON takes a cable out of his belt. The engine
coughs and dies. They start drifting backward again. JAR JAR
panics.

		JAR JAR
	Iyiiyi, wesa die'n here, hey!

QUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a
railing on the shore. The sub pulls the cable taut, and the
little craft hangs precariously over the edge of the
waterfall.

		QUI-GON
	Come on...

OBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the
cable. QUI-GON starts in after him.

		QUI-GON
	Come on, Jar Jar.

		JAR JAR
	No! Too scary!

		OBI-WAN
	Get up here!

		JAR JAR
	No a mighty no!

JAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall.

		JAR JAR
	Oie boie...mesa comen. Mesa comen!

JAR JAR starts to climb out of the sub. OBI-WAN is on shore
and helps to pull QUI-GON out of the water.

		OBI-WAN
	That was close.

		BATTLE DROID 3B3 (O.S.)
	Drop your weapons!

The TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in
front of them.

		BATTLE DROID 3B3

		JAR JAR
	Whoa!!!

EXT. THEED - PALACE - DAY

The waterfalls of Theed sparkle in the noonday sun.

INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS
(EIRTAE, YANE, PADME, RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by TWENTY
DROIDS. Capt. Panaka and FOUR NABOO GUARDS are also held at
gunpoint. NUTE and RUNE stand in the middle of the room.

		BIBBLE
	...how will you explain this invasion
	to the Senate?

		NUTE
	The Naboo and the Federation will
	forge a treaty that will legitimize
	our occupation here. I've been assured
	it will be ratified by the Senate.

		AMIDALA
	I will not co-operate.

		NUTE
	Now, now, your Highness. You are not
	going to like what we have in store
	for your people. In time, their
	suffering will persuade you to see
	our point of view. Commander.
	     (OOM-9 steps forward)
	Process them.

		OOM-9
	Yes, sir!
	     (turns to his sergeant)
	Take them to Camp Four.

The SERGEANT marches the GROUP out of the throne room.

EXT. PALACE - PLAZA - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTA, YANE, RABE, SACHE, Capt. Panaka,
SIO BIBBLE,

and FOUR GUARDS are led out of the palace by ten BATTLE
DROIDS. The plaza is filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS,
which they pass on their way to the detention camp.
Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak
across on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony
to begin an attack to rescue the QUEEN.

FOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS move
forward and are also cut down by the JEDIS' flashing
lightsabres until there is only the DROID SERGEANT left. The
SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to QUI-GON by the
Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI.

		JAR JAR
	Yousa guys bombad!

QUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting
used to this.  They move between two buildings.

		QUI-GON
	Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors,
	for the Supreme Chancellor.

		BIBBLE
	Your negotiations seem to have failed,
	Ambassador.

		QUI-GON
	The negotiations never took place.
	Your Highness, we must make contact
	with the republic.

Capt. Panaka steps forward.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	They've knocked out all our
	communications.

		QUI-GON
	Do you have transports?

		CAPT. PANAKA
	In the main hanger. This way.

THEY disappear down an alleyway as the ALARMS are sounded

INT. CENTRAL HANGER - HALLWAY - DAY

Capt. Panaka cracks open a side door to the central hanger.
QUI-GON looks in over his shoulder. OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, and
the rest of the group are behind him. They see several Naboo
spacecraft guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE DROIDS.  ALARMS can
be heard in the distance.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	There are too many of them.

		QUI-GON
	That won't be a problem.
	     (to Amidala)
	Your Highness, under the
	circumstances, Isuggest you come to
	Coruscant with us.

		AMIDALA
	Thank you, Ambassador, but my place
	is here with my people.

		QUI-GON
	They will kill you if you stay.

		BIBBLE
	They wouldn't dare.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	They need her to sign a treaty to
	make this invasion of theirs legal.
	They can't afford to kill her.

		QUI-GON
	The situation here is not what it
	seems. There is something else behind
	all this, Your Highness. There is no
	logic in the Federation's move here.
	My feelings tell me they will destroy
	you.

		BIBBLE
	Please, Your Highness, reconsider.
	Our only hope is for the Senate to
	side with us... Senator Palpatine
	will need your help.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Getting past their blockade is
	impossible, Your Highness.
	Any attempt to escape will be
	dangerous.

		BIBBLE
	Your Highness, I will stay here and
	do what I can...They will have to
	retain the Council of Governors in
	order to maintain control. But you
	must leave...

The QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.

		AMIDALA
	Either choice presents a great
	risk...to all of us...

		PADME
	We are brave, Your Highness.

		QUI-GON
	If you are to leave, Your Highness,
	it must be now.

		AMIDALA
	Then, I will plead our case before
	the Senate.
	     (to Bibble)
	Be careful, Governor.

INT. CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

The door opens to the main hanger. QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, JAR
JAR, Capt. Panaka, TWO GUARDS, and THREE HANDMAIDENS (PADME,
EIRTAE, RABE), followed by QUEEN AMIDALA, head for a sleek
chrome spacecraft. SIO BIBBLE, YANE and SACHE stay behind.
The HANDMAIDENS begin to cry.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	We need to free those pilots.

Capt. Panaka points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, and PILOTS
held in a corner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS.

		OBI-WAN
	I'll take care of that.

OBI-WAN heads toward the group of captured pilots.

QUI-GON and the QUEEN, Capt. Panaka, JAR JAR, and the rest
Of the GROUP approach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo
craft.

		GUARD DROID
	Where are you going?

		QUI-GON
	I'm Ambassador for the Supreme
	Chancellor, and I'm taking those
	people to Coruscant.

		DROID GUARD
	You're under arrest!

The DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the DROIDS
can fire, they are cut down. OTHER GUARDS run to their aid.
OBI-WAN attacks the GUARDS around the PILOTS. QUI-GON stands,
fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS rush on board the
spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC OLIE),
GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship.  The
OTHER PILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLR. After everyone
has made it onto the ship, QUI-GONjumps on board. ALARMS
sound. MORE DROIDS rush into the hanger and fire as the ship
takes off.

EXT. THEED - HANGER ENTRY - DAY (FX)

The ship exits the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS standing in the
hanger shoot at them.

EXT. SPACE (FX)

The sleek spacecraft speeds away from the planet of Naboo
and heads for the deadly Federation blockade.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

The PILOT, RIC OLIE, navigates toward the massive battleship,
QUI-GON and Capt. Panaka watch.

		RIC OLIE
	...our communications are still
	jammed.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DROID HOLD

JAR JAR is led into a low, cramped doorway by OBI-WAN.

		OBI-WAN
	Now stay here, and keep out of
	trouble.

OBI-WAN closes the door. JAR JAR looks around and sees a
long row of five short, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units).
The all look alike, except for thier paint color, and they
all seem to be shut down.

		JAR JAR
	Ello, boyos.
	     (no response)
	Disa wanna longo trip...hey?

JAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head
pops up a bit.  He lets out a gasp as he lifts the head.

		JAR JAR
	Tis opens?...Oooops!

Many springs and things come flying out.

JAR JAR quickly closes it again, very embarrassed.

		JAR JAR
	Yoi! Just yoken!

EXT. SPACE BATTLE

The Naboo Spacecraft, surrounded by explosions, head even
closer to the massive Federation battle ships.

INT.NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

		RIC OLIE
	There's the blockade, hang on.

Alarm sounds fill the Cockpit as Obi-Wan enters.

		RIC OLIE
	The shield generator's been hit. Our
	deflector shields can't withstand
	this. Power down... Hopefully the
	repair droids can fix it.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DROID HOLD

The lights go on, and all the Droids are activated. Droids
rush to an exterior air lock, except for the red one, who
runs into a wall. JAR JAR holds on for dear life.

One Little blue Astro Droid, who is especially dedicated,
lets out a loud screech as he passes JAR JAR, causing the
Gungan to jump.

The little Droid enters an air lock and is ejected onto the
exterior of the ship.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Stay on course!

		QUI-GON
	Do you have a cloaking device?

		CAPT. PANAKA
	No, this is not a warship, we have
	no weapons. We're a non- violent
	people, that is why the Federation
	was brave enough to attack us.

		RIC OLIE
	We won't make it. The shields are
	gone.

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - FEDERATION BATTLESHIP

The Droids pop onto the exterior of the Naboo Spacecraft;
the ship races across the surface of the massive Federation
Battleship, as its guns blast two Astro Droids to pieces.

		OBI-WAN
	We're losing droids fast.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	If they can't get those shield
	generators fixed we will be sitting
	ducks.

		RIC OLIE
	The shields are gone.

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - ENGINES

The Federation Battleship blows away one more Atro Droid.
The blue Droid connects some wires, causing sparks to fly.

		RIC OLIE
	Powers back! That little droid did
	it. He bypassed the main power drive.
	Deflector shield up, at maximum.

The lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into
the ship. The Naboo spacecraft races away from the Federation
battleship.

		RIC OLIE
	There's not enough power to get us
	to Coruscant...the hyperdrive is
	leaking.

		QUI-GON
	We'll have to land somewhere to refuel
	and repair the ship.

QUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.

		OBI-WAN
	Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small,
	out of the way, poor... The Trade
	Federation has no presence there.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	How can you be sure?

		QUI-GON
	It's controlled by the Hutts...

		CAPT. PANAKA
	The Hutts??

		OBI-WAN
	It's risky... but there's no
	alternative.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	You can't take Her Royal Highness
	there! The Hutts are gangsters... If
	they discovered her...

		QUI-GON
	...It would be no different than if
	we landed on a system controlled by
	the Federation... except the Hutts
	aren't looking for her, which gives
	us an advantage.

CPATAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The Naboo spacecraft races away.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

NUTE and RUNE sit around a conference table with a hologram
of DARTH SIDIOUS.

		NUTE
	We control all the cities in the
	North and are searching for any other
	settlements...

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	Destroy all high-ranking officials,
	Viceroy... slowly... quietly. And
	Queen Amidala, has she signed the
	treaty?

		NUTE
	She has disappeared, My Lord. One
	Naboo cruiser got pat the blockade.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	Viceroy, find her! I want that treaty
	signed.

		NUTE
	My Lord, it's impossible to locate
	the ship. It's out of our range.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	...not for a Sith...

A second SITH LORD appears behind DARTH SIDIOUS.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	...Viceroy, this is my apprentice.
	Lord Maul. He will find your lost
	ship.

		NUTE
	Yes, My Lord.

The hologram fades off.

		NUTE
	This is getting out of hand...now
	there are two of them.

		RUNE
	We should not have made this bargain.
	What will happen when the Jedi become
	aware of these Sith Lords?

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, Capt. Panaka, and the LITTLE BLUE DROID
stand before QUEEN AMIDALA and her THREE HANDMAIDENS, PADME,
EIRTAE and RABE.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	...An extremely well put together
	little droid. Without a doubt, it
	saved the ship, as well as our lives.

		AMIDALA
	It is to be commended... what is its
	number?

The LITTLE BLUE DROID lets out a series of bleeps. Capt.
Panaka leans over and scrapes some dirt off of the side of
the DROID and read the number:

		CAPT. PANAKA
	R2-D2, Your Highness.

		AMIDALA
	Thank you, Artoo Detoo. You have
	proven to be very loyal... Padme!

PADME bows before the QUEEN.

		AMIDALA
	Clean this droid up the best you
	can. It deserves our gratitude...
	     (to Panaka)
	Continue, Captain.

Capt. Panaka looks nervously to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON.

		QUI-GON
	Yor Highness, we are heading for a
	remote planet called Tatooine. It is
	a system far beyond the reach of the
	Trade Federation. There we will be
	able to make needed repairs, then
	travel on to Coruscant.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Your Highness, Tatooine is very
	dangerous.  It's controlled by an
	alliance of gangs called the Hutts.
	I do not agree with the Jedi on this.

		QUI-GON
	You must trust my judgement, Your
	Highness.

AMIDALA and PADME exchange looks. PADME moves next to the
DROID.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

PADME sits in the Main Area, cleaning R2-D2, the brave little
Astra Droid.  JAR JAR pops out of an open door.

		JAR JAR
	Hidoe!

Both PADME and ARTOO jump and let out a little SCREAM. The
Gungan is embarrassed that he frightened them.

		JAR JAR
	Sorry, nomeanen to scare yousa.

		PADME
	That's all right.

		JAR JAR
	I scovered oily back dare. Needen
	it?

		PADME

JAR JAR hands PADME the oil can.

	I'm Padme, I attend Her Highness,

ARTOO BEEPS a sympathetic beep.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and Capt. Panaka watch over RIC OLIE'S
shoulder. A large yellow planet appears directly ahead.  RIC
OLIE searches his scopes.

		OBI-WAN
	That's it. Tatooine.

		RIC OLIE
	There's a settlement...a spaceport,
	looks like.

		QUI-GON
	Land near the outskirts. We don't
	want to attract any attention.

EXT. TATOOINE - SPACE (FX)

The ship heads toward the planet of Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX)

The Naboo spacecraft lands in the desert in a swirl of dust.
The spaceport of Mos Espa is seen in the distance.

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

OBI-WAN is hoisting the hyperdrive out of a floor panel. JAR
JAR rushes up to him and falls to his knees.

		JAR JAR
	Obi-Wan, sire, pleeese, no mesa go!

		OBI-WAN
	Sorry, Qui-Gon's right. You'll make
	things less obvious.

JAR JAR walks back to ARTOO in the hallway as QUI-GON (dressed
as a farmer) enters the main area.

		OBI-WAN
	The Hyperdrive generator is gone. We
	will need a new one.

QUI-GON moves closer to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly to him.

		QUI-GON
	Don't let them send ant transmissions.
	Be wary... I sense a disturbance in
	the Force.

		OBI-WAN
	I fell it also, Master.

QUI-GON goes into the hallway to meet up with ARTOO and JAR
JAR. They head to the exit ramp.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

They start their trek across the desert toward the city of
Mos Espa.  In the distance, a strange looking caravan makes
its way toward the spaceport.

		JAR JAR
	Dis sun doen murder tada skin.

From the spaceship, Capt. Panaka and PADME run toward them.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Wait!

QUI-GON stops as they catch up. PADME is dresses in rough
peasant's garb.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Her Highness commands you to take
	her handmaiden with you. She wishes
	for her to observe the local...

		QUI-GON
	No more commands from Her Highness
	today, Captain. This spaceport is
	not going to be pleasant...

		CAPT. PANAKA
	The Queen wishes it. She is curious
	about this planet.

		PADME
	I've been trained in defense... I
	can take care of myself.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Don't make me go back and tell her
	you refuse.

		QUI-GON
	I don't have time to argue. But this
	is not a good idea. Stay close to
	me.

He gives PADME a stern look.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

The little GROUP walks down the main street of Mos Espa.
They pass dangerous looking citizens of all types. PADME
looks around in awe at this exotic enviroment.

		QUI-GON
	...moisture farms for the most part,
	but also a few indigenous tribes and
	scavengers. The few spaceports like
	this one are havens for those who do
	not wish to be found...

		PADME
	....like us.

JAR JAR is in a constant state of panic.

ARTOO whistles along, with perfect confidence.

		JAR JAR
	Dissen berry berry bad.
	     (steps in ooze)
	Ooooh...icky...icky...goo.

EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

The GROUP comes to a little plaza surrounded by several junk
spaceship dealers.

		QUI-GON
	We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

They head for a little junk shop that has a huge pile of
broken spaceships stacked up behind it.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, PADME, and ARTOO enter the dingy junk shop
and are greeted by WATTO, a pudgy blue alien who flies on
short little wings like a hummingbird.

		WATTO (SUBTITLED)
	Hi chuba da naga?
	(What do you want?)

		QUI-GON
	I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

		WATTO
	Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots
	of that. What kinda junk?
	     (subtitled)
	Peedenkel! Naba dee unko
	(Boy, get in here! Now!)


		QUI-GON
	My droid here has a readout of what
	I need.

A disheveled boy, ANAKIN SKYWALKER, runs in from the junk
yard.  He is about nine years old, very dirty, and dressed
in rags. WATTO raises a hand, and ANAKIN flinches.

		WATTO (SUBTITLED)
	Coona tee-tocky malia?
	(What took you so long?)


		ANAKIN (SUBTITLED)
	Mel tassa cho-passa...
	(I was cleaning the bin like you...)

		ANAKIN (SUBTITLED)


		WATTO (SUBTITLED)
	Chut-Chut! Ganda doe wallya.
	(Never mind! Watch the store)
	Me dwana no bata.
	(I've got some selling to do here.)
	     (to Gui-Gon)
	Soooo, let me take- a thee out back.
	Ni you'll find what you need.

ARTOO and QUI-GON follow WATTO toward the junk yard, leaving
JAR JAR with PADME and the young boy ANAKIN. JAR JAR picks
up a gizmo, trying to figure out its purpose. QUI-GON takes
the part out of his hand and puts it back.

		QUI-GON
	Don't touch anything.

JAR JAR makes a rude face to QUI-GON's back and sticks out
his long tongue.

ANAKIN sits on the counter, pretending to clean a part,
staring at PADME.

She is the most beautiful creaure he has ever seen in his
life. PADME is a little embarrassed by his stare, but she
musters up an amused smile.

Finally, he gets the courage to speak.

		ANAKIN
	Are you an angel?

		PADME
	What?

		ANAKIN
	An angel.  I've heard the deep space
	pilots talk about them. They live on
	the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are
	the most beautiful creatures in the
	universe.  They are good and kind,
	and so pretty they make even the
	most hardened spice pirate cry.

PADME looks at him, not knowing what to say. PADME : I've
never heard of angels.

		ANAKIN
	You must be one...maybe you just
	don't know it.

		PADME
	You're a funny little boy. How do
	you know so much?

		ANAKIN
	Since I was very little, three, I
	think. My Mom and I were sold to
	Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us,
	betting on the Podraces, to Watto,
	who's a lot better master than
	Gardulla, I think.

		PADME
	You're... a slave?

ANAKIN looks at PADME defiantly.

		ANAKIN
	I am a person! My name is Anakin.

		PADME
	I'm sorry. I don't fully understand.
	     (looking around)
	This is a strange world to me.

ANAKIN studies her intently.

		ANAKIN
	You are a strange girl to me.

JAR JAR pushes the nose on what appears to be a LITTLE DROID,
and it instantly comes to life, grows legs and arms, and
starts marching around, knocking over everything. JAR JAR
hold on but can't stop it.

		ANAKIN
	Hit the nose!

JAR JAR hits the nose, and the DROID collapses back into its
original state. ANAKIN and PADME laugh. ANAKIN watches PADME
straighten her hair.

EXT. WATTO'S JUNK YARD - BEHIND SHOP - DAY

WATTO reads a small portable monitor he is holding. He stands
before a hyperdrive.

		WATTO
	...Here it is...a T-14 hyperdrive
	generator!! Thee in luck, I'm the
	only one hereabouts who has one...but
	thee might as well buy a new ship.
	It would be cheaper, I think...Sying
	of which, how's thee going to pay
	for all this?

		QUI-GON
	I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

		WATTO
	Republic credits?!?  Republic credits
	are no good out here. I need something
	more real...

		QUI-GON
	I don't have anything else.
	     (raising his hand))
	But credits will do fine.

		WATTO
	No they won'ta.

QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand again.

		QUI-GON
	Credits will do fine.

		WATTO
	No, they won'ta. What you think you're
	some kinda Jedi, waving your hand
	around like that? I'm a Toydarian.
	Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only
	money. No money, no parts! No deal!
	And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
	I promise you that.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

JAR JAR pulls a part out of a stack of parts to inspect it,
and they all come tumblimg down. He struggles to catch them,
only to knock more down.

ANAKIN and PADME are oblivious.

		ANAKIN
	...wouldn't have lasted long if I
	weren't so good at fixing things.
	I'm making my own droid...

QUI-GON hurries into the shop, followed by ARTOO.

		QUI-GON
	We're leaving.

JAR JAR follows QUI-GON. PADME gives ANAKIN a loving look.

		PADME
	I'm glad I met you, ...ah...

		ANAKIN
	...Anakin.

		PADME
	Anakin.

		ANAKIN
	Anakin Skywalker.

		PADME
	Padme Naberrie.

PADME turns, and ANAKIN looks sad as he watches her leave.

		ANAKIN
	I'm glad I met you too.

WATTO enters the junk yard, shaking his head.

		WATTO (SUBTITLED)
	Ootmians! Tinka me chasa hopoe ma
	booty na nolia.
	(Outlanders! They think because we
	live so far from the center, we don't
	know nothing.)

		ANAKIN (SUBTITLED)
	La lova num botaffa.
	(They seemed nice to me.)

		WATTO (SUBTITLED)
	Fweepa niaga. Tolpa da bunky dunko.
	(Clean the racks, then you can go
	home.)

ANAKIN lets out a "yipee" and runs out the back.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - ALCOVE - DAY

QUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, and PADME have found a quiet spot
between two buildings. The busy street beyond is filled with
dangerous looking creatures. QUI-GON is talking on his com-
link, while JAR JAR nervously watches the street. OBI-WAN is
in the main hold of the Naboo craft.

		QUI-GON
	...Obi-Wan, you're sure there isn't
	anything of value left on board?

		OBI-WAN (V.O.)
	A few containers of supplies, the
	Queen's wardrobe, maybe. Not enough
	for you to barter with. Not in the
	ammounts you're talking about.

		QUI-GON
	All right. Another solution will
	present itself. I'll check back.

QUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main
street. JAR JAR grabs his arm.

		JAR JAR
	Noah gain...da beings hereabouts
	cawazy. Wesa be robbed un crunched.

		QUI-GON
	Not likely. We have nothing of value,
	that's our problem.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - MARKET - DAY

QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street.
JAR JAR is walking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor
cafe filled with a rough gang of aliens, one of which is
especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like creature. JAR JAR
stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs
hanging on a wire. He looks around to see if anyone is
looknig, then sticks out his tongue, and gets hold of one,
pulling it into his mouth.

Unfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire. The
vendor suddenly appears.

		VENDOR
	Hey, that will be seven truguts!!

JAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away,
ricochets around the market, and lands in Sebulba's soup,
splashing him. As JAR JAR moves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA
jumps up on the table and grabs the hapless Gungan.

		SEBULBA (SUBTITLED)
	Chuba!!
	(You!!)

		JAR JAR
	Who, mesa??

		SEBULBA (SUBTITLED)
	Ni chuba na??
	(Is this yours??)

SEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL
OTHER CREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to
the ground. The Gungan desperately tries to scramble to
safety.

		JAR JAR
	     (to himself)
	Why mesa always da one??

		ANAKIN (O.S.)
	Because you're afraid.

JAR JAR turns to see ANAKIN pushing his way next to him. The
boy stands up to SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.

		ANAKIN (SUBTITLED)
	Chess ko, Sebulba...Coo wolpa tooney
	rana.
	(Careful, Sebulba...This one's very
	connected.)


SEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN.

		SEBULBA (SUBTITLED)
	Tooney rana nu pratta dunko, shag.
	(Connected?? Whada you mean, slave?)

		ANAKIN (SUBTITLED)
	Oh da Hutt...cha porko ootman
	geesa...me teesa rodda co pana pee
	choppa chawa.
	(As in Hutt...big time outlander,
	this one... I'd hate to see you diced
	before we race again.)


		SEBULBA (SUBTITLED)
	Neek me chowa, wermo, mo killee ma
	klounkee
	(Next time we race, wermo, it will
	be the end of you!)
	Una noto wo shag, me wompity du pom
	pom.
	(If you weren't a slave, I'd squash
	you right now.)


SEBULBA turns away.

		ANAKIN (SUBTITLED)
	Eh, chee bana do mullee ra.
	(Yeah, it'd be a pity if you had to
	pay for me.)


QUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.

		ANAKIN
	Hi! Your buddy here was about to be
	turned into orange goo. He picked a
	fight with a Dug. An especially
	dangerous Dug called Sebulba.

		JAR JAR
	Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen.
	Dat's da last ting mesa wanten.

		QUI-GON
	Nevertheless, the boy is right...
	you were heading for trouble. Thank
	you, my young friend.

PADME looks at ANAKINB and smiles; he smiles back. They start
walking down the crowded street.

		JAR JAR
	Mesa doen nutten!

		ANAKIN
	Fear attracts the fearful. He was
	trying to overcome his fear by
	squashing you... be less afraid.

		PADME
	And that works for you.

		ANAKIN
	To a point.
	     (he smiles)

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

OBI-WAN stands in front of the Naboo spacecraft as the wind
picks up and begins to whip at his robe. Capt. Panaka exits
the ship and joins him.

		OBI-WAN
	This storm's going to slow them down.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	It looks pretty bad. We'd better
	seal the ship.

Capt. Panaka'S comlink sounds off.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Yes?
	     (listens)
	We'll be right there.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN and the GROUP stop at a fruit stand run by a jolly,
but very poor, old lady named JIRA.

		ANAKIN
	How are you feeling today, Jira?

		JIRA
	The heat's never been kind to me,
	you know, Annie!

		ANAKIN
	Guess what? I've found that cooling
	unit I've been searching for.

It's pretty beat up, but I'll have it fixed up for you in no
time, I promise.

		JIRA
	You're a fine boy, Annie.

		ANAKIN
	I'll take four pallies today.
	     (to Padme)
	You'll like these...

ANAKIN reaches in his pocket and comes up with three coins.
He drops one.

QUI-GON picks it up, revealing for a moment, his lightsabre.

		ANAKIN
	Whoops, I thought I had more... Make
	thgat three, I'm not hungry.

The wind picks up. SHOP OWNERS are starting to close up their
shops as JIRA gives them their pallies.

		JIRA
	Gracious, my bones are aching...
	storm's coming on, Annie. You'd better
	get home quick.

		ANAKIN
	     (to QUI-GON)
	Do you have shelter?

		QUI-GON
	We'll head back to our ship.

		ANAKIN
	Is it far?

		PADME
	On the outskirts.

		ANAKIN
	You'll never reach the outskirts in
	time... sandstorms are very, very
	dangerous. Come with me. Hurry!

The GROUP follows ANAKIN as he rushes down the windy street.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - STREET - SANDSTORM - DAY

The wind is blowing hard as QUI-GON, JAR JAR, and PADME follow
ANAKIN down the street and into a slave hovel.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME enter a small living space.

		ANAKIN
	Mom! Mom! I'm home.

		JAR JAR
	Dissen cozy.

Anakin's mother, SHMI SKYWALKER, a warm, friendly woman of
forty, enters from her work area and is startled to see the
room full of people.

		SHMI
	Oh, my!! Annie, what's this?

		ANAKIN
	These are my friends, Mom. This is
	Padme, and...gee, I don't know any
	of your names.

		QUI-GON
	I'm Qui-Gon Jinn, and this is Jar
	Jar Binks. ARTOO lets out a little
	beep.

		PADME
	...and our droid, Artoo-Detoo.

		ANAKIN
	I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

		SHMI
	Anakin! Why are they here?

		ANAKIN
	A sandstorm, Mom. Listen.

The wind HOWLS outside.

		QUI-GON
	Your son was kind enough to offer us
	shelter.

		ANAKIN
	Come on! Let me show you Threepio!

ANAKIN leads PADME into the other room. ARTOO follows, beeping
all the way.

QUI-GON takes five small capsules from his utility belt and
hands them to SHMI.

		QUI-GON
	I have enough food for a meal.

		SHMI
	Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
	I'm sorry if I was abrupt. I'll never
	get used to Anakin's surprises.

		QUI-GON
	He's a very special boy.

SHMI looks at him as if he's discovered a secret.

		SHMI
	Yes, I know.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - BEDROOM - DAY

ANAKIN shows off his ANDROID, which is lying on his workbench.
There is one eye in the head; the body, arms, and legs have
no outer coverings.

		ANAKIN
	Isn't he great?! He's not finished
	yet.

		PADME
	He's wonderful!

		ANAKIN
	You reall like him? He's a protocol
	droid...to help Mom. Watch!

ANAKIN pushes a switch, and the DROID sits up. Anakin rushes
around, grabs an eye and puts it in one of the sockets.

		THREEPIO
	How do you do, I am See-Threepio,
	Human Cyborg Relations. How might I
	serve you?

		PADME
	He's perfect.

		ANAKIN
	When the storm is over, you can see
	my racer. I'm building a Podracer!

PADME smiles at his enthusiasm. ARTOO lets out a flurry of
beeps and whistles.

		THREEPIO
	I beg your pardon... what do you
	mean I'm naked?

ARTOO BEEPS

		THREEPIO
	My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness.
	How embarrassing!

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

AMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, and OBI-WAN watch a very bad
transmission of a SIO BIBBLE hologram.

		BIBBLE
	...cut off all food supplies until
	you return... the death toll is
	catastrophic... we must bow to their
	wishes, Your Highness...Please tell
	us what to do! If you can hear us,
	Your Highness, you must contact me...

AMIDALA looks upset...almost nervous.

		OBI-WAN
	It's a trick. Send no reply... Send
	no transmission of any kind.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON listens to his comlink. OBI-WAN is in the cockpit.

		OBI-WAN
	...the Queen is upset... but absolutly
	no reply was sent.

		QUI-GON
	It sounds like bait to establish a
	connection trace.

		OBI-WAN
	What if it is true and the people
	are dying?

		QUI-GON
	Either way, we're running out of
	time.

EXT. CORUSCANT - BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT

DARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL look out over the vast city.

		DARTH MAUL
	Tatooine is sparsely populated. If
	the trace was correct, I will find
	them quickly, Master.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	Move against the Jedi first... you
	will then have no difficulty taking
	the Queen back to Naboo, where she
	will sign the treaty.

		DARTH MAUL
	At last we will reveal ourselves to
	the Jedi. At last we will have
	revenge.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	You have been well trained, my young
	apprentice, they will be no match
	for you. It is too late for them to
	stop us now. Everything is going as
	planned. The Republic will soon be
	in my command.

The hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as DARTH SIDIOUS looks
out over the city.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SANDSTORM - DAY

The giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo
spaceship on the outskirts of the city center, where Watto's
ship is; and the slave quarters, where drifts of sand begin
building up against Anakin's house.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around
a makeshift table, having dinner as the wind howls outside.

JAR JAR slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at
him. He turns a little brighter red.

		SHMI
	All slaves have transmitters placed
	inside their bodies somewhere.

		ANAKIN
	I've been working on a scanner to
	try and locate them, but no luck.

		SHMI
	Any attempt to escape...

		ANAKIN
	...and they blow you up...poof!

PADME and JAR JAR are horrified.

		JAR JAR
	How wude.

		PADME
	I can't believe there is still slavery
	in the galaxy. The Republic's anti-
	slavery laws...

		SHMI
	The Republic doesn't exist out here...
	we must survive on our own.

An awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment.

		ANAKIN
	Have you ever seen a Podrace?

PADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI.
JAR JAR snatches some food from a bowl at the other end of
the table with his tongue.

QUI-GON gives him a dirty look.

		QUI-GON
	They have Podracing on Malastare.
	Very fast, very dangerous.

		ANAKIN
	I'm the only human who can do it.

SHMI looks at her son.

		ANAKIN
	Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's
	true. Watto says he's never heard of
	a human doing it.

		QUI-GON
	You must have Jedi reflexes if you
	race Pods.

ANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food
from the bowl with his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs
it between his thumb and forefinger. JAR JAR is startled.

		QUI-GON
	Don't do that again.

JAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-
GON lets go of the tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's
mouth.

		ANAKIN
	I... I was wondering... something...

		QUI-GON
	What?

		ANAKIN
	Well, ahhh... you're a Jedi Knight,
	aren't you?

		QUI-GON
	What makes you think that?

		ANAKIN
	I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi
	carry that kind of weapon.

QUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.

		QUI-GON
	Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it
	from him.

		ANAKIN
	I don't think so... No one can kill
	a Jedi Knight.

		QUI-GON
	I wish that were so...

		ANAKIN
	I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came
	back here and freed all the slaves...
	have you come to free us?

		QUI-GON
	No, I'm afraid not...

		ANAKIN
	I think you have... why else would
	you be here?

QUI-GON thinks for a moment.

		QUI-GON
	I can see there's no fooling you...
	     (leans forward)
	You mustn't let anyone know about
	us... we're on our way to Coruscant,
	the central system in the Republic,
	on a very important mission, and it
	must be kept secret.

		ANAKIN
	Coruscant... wow... how did you end
	up here in the outer rim?

		PADME
	Our ship was damaged, and we're
	stranded here until we can repair
	it.

		ANAKIN
	I can help! I can fix anything!

		QUI-GON
	I believe you can, but our first job
	is to aquire the parts we need...

		JAR JAR
	Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

		PADME
	These junk dealers must have a
	weakness of some kind.

		SHMI
	Gambling. Everything here revolves
	around betting on those awful races.

		QUI-GON
	Podracing... Greed can be a powerful
	ally.. if it's used properly.

		ANAKIN
	I've built a racer! It's the fastest
	ever... There's a big race tomorrow,
	on Boonta Eve. You could enter my
	pod. It's all but finished...

		SHMI
	Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let
	you...

		ANAKIN
	Watto doesn't know I've built it.
	     (to Qui-Gon))
	You could make him think it's your's,
	and you could get him to let me pilot
	it for you.

QUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.

		SHMI
	I don't want you to race, Annie...
	It's awful. I die every time Watto
	makes you do it.

		ANAKIN
	But Mom, I love it... and they need
	help... they're in trouble. The prize
	money would more than pay for the
	parts they need.

		JAR JAR
	Wesa ina pitty bad goo.

		GUI-GON
	Your mother's right. Is there anyone
	friendly to the Republic who might
	be able to help us?

SHMI shakes her head no.

		ANAKIN
	We have to help them, Mom...you said
	that the biggest problem in the
	universe is no one helps each other...

		SHMI
	Anakin, don't...

JAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat.

		PADME
	I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put
	your son in danger. We will find
	another way...

		SHMI
	No, Annie's right, there is no other
	way... I may not like it, but he can
	help you... he was meant to help
	you.

		ANAKIN
	Is that a yes? That is a yes!

The storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel.

EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

The storm has passed. VENDORS and STREET PEOPLE clean up the
mess and rebuild their food stalls.  JAR JAR sits on a box
in front of Watto's parts shop, watching all the activity
with growing nervousness. ARTOO is standing next to him.
PADME stops QUI-GON as he is about to enter the shop.

		PADME
	Are you sure about this? Trusting
	our fate to a boy we hardly know.
	The Queen will not approve.

		QUI-GON
	The Queen does not need to know.

		PADME
	Well, I don't approve.

QUI-GON turns and starts into the shop.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

WATTO and ANAKIN are in the middle of an animated discussion
in Huttese.

		WATTO
	Patta go bolla!

		ANAKIN
	No batta!

		WATTO
	Pedunky. Maa kee cheelya.

		ANAKIN
	Bayno, Bayno!

QUI-GON walks in, and WATTO and ANAKIN join him.

		WATTO
	The boy tells me you wanta sponser
	hi insa race. You can't afford parts.
	How can you do this? Not on Republic
	credits, I think.
	     (he laughs)

		QUI-GON
	My ship will be the entry fee.

QUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of
his pocket, and a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears
about a foot long in front of WATTO. He studies it.

		WATTO
	Not bad... not bad... a Nubian.

		QUI-GON
	It's in good order, except for the
	parts we need.

		WATTO
	...but what would the boy ride? He
	smashed up my Pod in the last race.
	It will take some time to fix it.

ANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.

		ANAKIN
	Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...
	Sebulba flashed me with his vent
	ports. I actually saved the Pod...
	mostly.

		WATTO
	     (laughing))
	That you did. The boy is good, no
	doubts there.

		QUI-GON
	I have... acquired a Pod in a game
	of chance. "The fastest ever built."

		WATTO
	I hope you didn't kill anyone I know
	for it.
	     (laughs))
	So, you supply the Pod and the entry
	fee; I supply the boy. We split the
	winnings fifty-fifty, I think.

		QUI-GON
	Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be
	fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the
	cash for the entry. If we win, you
	keep all the winnings, minus the
	cost of the parts I need... If we
	lose, you keep my ship.

WATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.

		QUI-GON
	Either way, you win.

		WATTO (SUBTITLED)
	Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya.
	(Your friend is a follish one,
	methinks.)

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - TATOOINE DESERT - DAY

OBI-WAN stands outside the Naboo spacecraft, speaking into
his comlink.

QUI-GON is on the back porch of the hovel.

		OBI-WAN
	What if this plan fails, Master? We
	could be stuck here for a long time.

		QUI-GON (V.O.)
	A ship without a power supply will
	not get us anywhere, and there is
	something about this boy...

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

QUI-GON puts the comlink away as SHMI comes onto the porch
PADME, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, and ARTOO work on the engines of the
Podracer in the courtyard below.

		QUI-GON
	You should be proud of your son. He
	gives without any thought of reward.

		SHMI
	He knows nothing of greed. He has...

		QUI-GON
	He has special powers.

		SHMI
	Yes...

		QUI-GON
	He can see things before they happen.
	That's why he appears to have such
	quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.

		SHMI
	He deserves better than a slave's
	life.

		QUI-GON
	The Force is unusally strong with
	him, that much is clear. Who was his
	father?

		SHMI
	There was no father, that I know
	of... I carried him, I gave him
	birth... I can't explain what
	happened. Can you help him?

		QUI-GON
	I'm afraid not. Had he been born in
	the Republic, we would have identified
	him early, and he would have become
	Jedi, no doubt...he has the way.
	But it's too late for him now, he's
	too old.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - DAY

KITSTER (a young boy about Anakin's age), SEEK (a boy of
ten), AMEE (a girl of six), and WALD (a Greedo Type, six
years old) join ANAKIN, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME securing
some wiring.

		ANAKIN
	Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend
	Kitster, and Seek, Amee, and Wald.

All whistle, hoot, and speak a greeting.

		KITSTER
	Wow, a real Astro Droid...how'd you
	get so lucky?

		ANAKIN
	This isn't the half of it. I'm entered
	in the Boonta Race tomorrow!

		KITSTER
	What? With this??

		WALD (SUBTITLED)
	Annie, Jesko na joka.
	(You are such a joke, Annie.)

		AMEE
	You've been working on that thing
	for years. It's never going to run.

		SEEK
	Come on, let's go play ball. Keep it
	up, Annie, and you're gonna be bug
	squash.

SEEK, WALD, and AMEE take off, laughing. JAR JAR is fiddling
with one of the energy binder plates.

		ANAKIN
	Hey! Jar Jar! Stay away from those
	energy binders...

		JAR JAR
	Who, mesa?

		ANAKIN
	If your hand gets caught in that
	beam, it will go numb for hours.

JAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little
electronic pop, zaps him in the mouth and jumps back. JAR
JAR tries to say something, but his mouth is numb and his
words are garbled.

		JAR JAR
	Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho.
	     (gibberish)

		KITSTER
	But you don't even know if this thing
	will run.

		ANAKIN
	It will.

QUI-GON approaches the GROUP and gives ANAKIN a small battery.
JAR JAR gets his hand caught in the afterburner and tries to
tell Anakin, but can't get words out that make sense.

		QUI-GON
	I think it's time we found out. Use
	this power charge.

		ANAKIN
	Yes, sir!!

ANAKIN jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant
engines. He puts the power pack back into the dashboard.
EVERYONE backs away, except for JAR JAR who calls for help.
Finally PADME frees him and the engines ignite with a ROAR.
EVERYONE cheers.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

SHMI, watching from the porch, smiles sadly.

EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - BALCONY - NIGHT

ANAKIN sits on the balcony rail of his hovel as QUI-GON tends
to a cut. The BOY leans back to look at the vast blanket of
stars in the sky.

		QUI-GON
	Sit still, Annie. Let me clean this
	cut.

		ANAKIN
	There are so many! Do they all have
	a system of planets?

		QUI-GON
	Most of them.

		ANAKIN
	Has anyone been to them all?

		QUI-GON
	     (laughs)
	Not likely.

		ANAKIN
	I want to be the first one to see
	them all... Ouch!

QUI-GON wipes a patch of blood off ANAKIN'S arm.

		QUI-GON
	There, good as new...

SHMI yells from inside the hovel.

		SHMI (O.S.)
	Annie, bedtime!

QUI-GON scrapes ANAKIN's blood onto a comlink chip.

		ANAKIN
	What are you doing?

		QUI-GON
	Checking your blood for infections.

		ANAKIN
	I've never seen...

		SHMI (O.S.)
	Annie! I'm not goiung to tell you
	again!

		QUI-GON
	Go on, you have a big day tomorrow.
	     (beat)
	Goodnight.

ANAKIN rolls his eyes and runs into the hovel. QUI-GON takes
the blood stained chip and inserts it into the comlink, then
calls OBI-WAN.

		QUI-GON
	Obi-Wan...

		OBI-WAN
	Yes, Master.

		QUI-GON
	Make an analysis of this blood sample
	I'm sending you.

		OBI-WAN
	Wait a minute...

		QUI-GON
	I need a midi-chlorian count.

		OBI-WAN
	All right. I've got it.

		QUI-GON
	What are your readings?

		OBI-WAN
	Something must be wrong with the
	transmission.

		QUI-GON
	Here's a signal check.

		OBI-WAN
	Strange. The transmission seems to
	be in good order, but the reading's
	off the chart... over twenty thousand.

		QUI-GON
	     (almost to himself)
	That's it then.

		OBI-WAN
	Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-
	chlorian count that high!

		QUI-GON
	No Jedi has.

		OBI-WAN
	What does it mean?

		QUI-GON
	I'm not sure.

The JEDI KNIGHT looks up and sees SHMI in the doorway watching
him.

Embarrassed, she goes back into the kitchen while QUI-GON
ponders the situation.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - NIGHT

The sinister looking Sith spacecraft lands on top of a desert
mesa at dus, scattering a herd of banthas. DARTH MAUL walks
to the edge of the mesa and studies the landscape with a
pair of electrobinoculars. He picks out the lights of three
different cities in the distance, then pushes buttons on his
electronic armband.

Six football-sized PROBE DROIDS float out of the ship and
head off in three different directions toward the cities.

DARTH MAUL stands on the mesa and watches them through his
electrobinoculars.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - SUNRISE

Padme exits the hovel.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - SUNRISE

As the twin suns rise, ARTOO is busy painting the racing
Pod. ANAKIN is asleep. PADME passes ARTOO.

		PADME
	I hope you're about finished.

ARTOO whistles a positive reply. PADME sees KITSTER riding
toward them on an EOPIE, a strange camel-lile creature. He
is leading a second EOPIE behind him.  PADME goes over to
ANAKIN. He looks very vulnerable as he sleeps. She watches
him, then touches him on the cheek. ANAKIN wakes up, yawns,
and looks at her, a little puzzled.

		ANAKIN
	You were in my dream... you were
	leading a huge army into battle.

		PADME
	I hope not, I hate fighting. Your
	mother wants you to come in and clean
	up. We have to leave soon.

ANAKIN stands up and stretches just as KITSTER arrives.

		ANAKIN
	Hook 'em up, Kitster.
	     (to Padme))
	I won't be long. Where's Qui-Gon?

		PADME
	He and Jar Jar left already. They're
	with Watto at the arena.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

RACE CREWS mill about outside the Main Hanger.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

The hanger is a large building with a dozen or so Podracers
being readied for the race. ALIEN CREWS and PILOTS rush about,
making last minute fixes on their vehicles. WATTO, QUI-GON,
and JAR JAR walk through the activity.

		WATTO
	...I want to see your spaceship the
	moment the race is over.

		QUI-GON
	Patience, my blue friend. You'll
	have your winnings before the suns
	set, and we'll be far away from here.

		WATTO
	Not if your ship belongs to me, I
	think... I warn you, no funny
	business.

		QUI-GON
	You don't think Anakin will win?

WATTO stops before an orange racer. Sitting to one side,
having his shoulders and neck massaged by TWIN YOBANAS, is
SEBULBA.

		WATTO
	Don't get me wrongo. I have great
	faith in the boy. He's a credit to
	your race, but Sebulba there is going
	to win, I think.

		QUI-GON
	Why?

		WATTO
	He always wins.
	     (laughs)
	I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.

		QUI-GON
	I'll take that bet.

		WATTO
	     (suddenly stops
	     laughing)
	What??!! What do you mean?

		QUI-GON
	I'll wager my new racing pod
	against... say... the boy and his
	mother.

		WATTO
	A Pod for slaves. I don't think so...
	well, poerhaps. Just one...the mother,
	maybe...the boy isn't for sale.

		QUI-GON
	The boy is small, he can't be worth
	much.

WATTO shakes his head.

		QUI-GON
	For the fastest Pod ever built?!

WATTO shakes his head again.

		QUI-GON
	Both, or no bet.

		WATTO
	No Pod's worth two slaves... not by
	a long shot... one slave or nothing.

		QUI-GON
	The boy, then...

WATTO pulls out a small cube from his pocket.

		WATTO
	We'll let fate decide. Blue it's the
	boy, red his mother...

WATTO tosses the cube down. QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly;
it turns blue.

QUI-GON smiles. WATTO is angry.

		WATTO
	You won the small toss, outlander,
	bou you won't win the race, so... it
	makes little difference.

ANAKIN and PADME enter the hanger on one of the EOPIES,
pulling an engine.  KITSTER, on the other EOPIE, is pulling
another engine. With THREEPIO walking alongside, ARTOO
trundles behind, pulling the Pod with SHMI sitting on it.
WATTO passes ANAKIN as he leaves.

		WATTO (SUBTITLED)
	Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee
	chobodd.
	(Better stop your friends betting,
	or I'll end up owning him, too.)

WATTO walks off, laughing.

		ANAKIN
	What did he mean by that?

		QUI-GON
	I'll tell you later.

ARTOO beeps at THREEPIO.

		THREEPIO
	Oh my! Space travel sounds rather
	perilous.

ARTOO emits a series of beeps.

		THREEPIO
	I can assure you they will never get
	me onto one of those dreadful
	starships!

		KITSTER
	     (to Anakin)
	This is so wizard! I'm sure you'll
	do it this time, Annie.

		PADME
	Do what?

		KITSTER
	Finish the race, of course!

		PADME
	You've never won a race?

		ANAKIN
	Well... not exactly...

		PADME
	Not even finished?!

ANAKN looks sheepish.

		ANAKIN
	...but Kitster's right, I will this
	time.

		QUI-GON
	Of course you will.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

One of Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS slowly floats down the main
street of Tatooine. It looks in shops and studies PEOPLE as
it searches for OBI-WAN, QI-GON, or the QUEEN.

EXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY

An EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE reveals a vast arena in the
Tatooine desert. A large semi-circular amphitheatre that
holds at least a hundred thousand people dominates the
landscape. Large viewing platforms loom over the racetrack.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX)

A two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the scene.

	A: Toogi! Toogie!
	(Greetings)
	Toong mee cha kulkah du Boonta magi!

	(We have perfect weather today for
	the Boonta classic. The most hazardous
	of all Podraces.)

	B : That's absolutly right.  And a
	big turnout here, from all corners
	of the Outer Rim territories. I see
	the contestants are making their way
	out onto the starting grid.

EXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY

On the left side of the tracks across from the grandstands,
a line of Podracers emerges from the large hanger, surrounded
by several CREW MEMBERS. Pods are pulled by a wide variety
of CREATURES and are led by aliens carrying flags. The PILOTS
stand facing the royal box.

		FODE/BEED (O.S.)
	A : La Yma beestoo

	A : O grandio lust, Jabba Du Hutt,
	amu intoe tah parena.
	(His honor, our glorious host, Jabba
	the Hutt has entered the arena.)


The crowd ROARS. SEVERAL OTHER SLUG-LIKE HUTTS follow, along
with humans and aliens. Several SLAVE GIRLS on a chain are
led alongside JABBA.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

SEBULBA, who is right next to ANAKIN, stands and waves to
his fans. A small pep band plays as his fans wave and cheer.

KITSTER attaches the giant engins to Anakin's Pod with a
long cable. SHMI gives ANAKIN a big hug and kiss. She looks
him right in the eye.

		SHMI
	Be safe.

		ANAKIN
	I will, Mom. I promise.

She leaves as ANAKIN checks the cable hitches.

		JABBA
	...Mawhonic tuta Hok, Teemto Pagalies
	tuta Moonus Mandel, Anakin SKywalker
	tuta Tatoonine....

The CROWD YELLS. ANAKIN waves to the crowd, as JABBA continues
with his introductions. SEBULBA moves over to one of Anakin's
engines. KITSTER and JAR JAR unhitch the EOPIES, and KITSTER
leads them away. ARTOO beeps that everything is OK. JAR JAR
pats ANAKIN on the back.

		JAR JAR
	Dis berry loony, Annie. May da guds
	be kind, mesa palo.

PADME comes up and gives ANAKIN a little kiss on the cheeek.
SEBULBA bangs on a part protruding from Anakin's engine. He
looks around to see if anyone has noticed.

		PADME
	You carry all our hopes.

		ANAKIN
	I won't let you down.

PADME moves away as SEBULBA edges his way next to ANAKIN and
gives him a sinister grin.

		SEBULBA
	Bazda wahota, shag. Dobiella Nok.
	Yoka to Bantha poodoo.
	(You won't walk away from this one,
	slave scum! You're Bantha poodoo.)


		ANAKIN (SUBTITLED)
	Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo.
	(Don't count on it, slime-ball.)

ANAKIN looks the evil SEBULBA in the eye with a cold stare.
QUI-GON approaches, and SEBULBA backs off toward his racer.

		JABBA (SUTITLED)
	...Ka bazza kundee hodrudda!
	(...Let the challenge begin!)

The CROWD lets out a LOUD CHEER. QUI-GON helps ANAKIN into
his Pod. The boy straps himself into the tiny racer.

		QUI-GON
	Are you all set, Annie?
	     (Anakin nods)
	Remember, concentrate on the moment.
	Feel. Don't think. Trust your
	instincts.
	     (he smiles)
	May the Force be with you.

QUI-GON steps away as ANAKIN puts on his goggles. The PILOTS
flip switches, and powerful energy binders shoot between the
engines. ANAKIN flips a switch, and his engine starts. The
incredible ROAR of high-powered engines igniting echoes
throughout the arena. One driver, ODY MANDRELL, yells at a
droid (DUM-4) to get away from the front of his engine.  The
crowd is tense.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

The giant power-house engines torque as the PILOTS gun them.
The PILOTS flip switches, and poerful energy binders shoot
between the engines. Aliens carrying large flags move off
the track. JAR JAR covers his eyes.

		JAR JAR
	Mesa no watch. Dissen ganna be messy!

		FODE/BEED
	A : Ya pawa culka doe rundee! (The
	power couplings are being activated)
	B : Hey, it looks like they're
	clearing the grid.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

SHMI looks nervously to QUI-GON as he enters a veiwing
platform. PADME and JAR JAR are already on board. The platform
rises like an elevator.

		SHMI
	Is he nervous?

		QUI-GON
	He's fine.

		PADME
	You Jedi are far too reckless. The
	Queen...

		QUI-GON
	The Queen trusts my judgment, young
	handmaiden. You should too.

		PADME
	You assume too much.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX)

The earth-pounding ROAR of the engines revving is deafening.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX)

Jabba bites off the head of a frog and spits it at a gong,
signaling the start of the race.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

On a bridge over the track, a great green light at the center
flashes. The Podracers shoot forward with a high-pitches
scream. ANAKIN'S engine floods and coughs - then dies. All
the other Podracers except one swerve around him and dissapear
down the track. The slave boy struggles to get his racer
started. The two-headed announcer reports.

		FODE/BEED (O.S.)
	A : An dare ovv!
	(And they're off!)

	B : Oh...wait. Little Skywalker has
	stalled.

PADME and JAR JAR are very dissapointed with ANAKIN. QUI-GON
puts his arm around a very worried SHMI to comfort her.
Finally, Anakin's engines ignite. He zooms away after the
receeding pack of competitors, leaving one quadra-Pod racer
still trying to get started. The two-headed ANNOUNCER
describes the race as it progresses.

		FODE/BEED (O.S.)
	B : And there goes Skywalker... He'll
	be hard pressed to catch up with the
	leaders today.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

The Podracers fly across the desert. SEBULBA is running neck
and neck with MAWHONIC. They round the first turn in the
track, side by side.  SEBULBA drives his Pod into his rival,
forcing him into the wall of a large rock formation. MAWHONIC
crashes in a spectacular display of fire and smoke.  ANAKIN
is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them
easily.

One of the drivers, GASGANO, won't let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN
tries to pass him on one side and is cut off. He then tries
to pass him on the other side ansd is cut off. As they come
up on a cliff drop-off, ANAKIN backs off, then guns it as
GASGANO goes over the cliff. ANAJIN accelerates so fast that
he sails right over the top of GASGANO and speeds away.

Four TUSKEN RAIDERS perched above the race course fire their
rifles at the Pods racing in the canyon below them. One shot
ricochets off the back of Anakin's Pod.

		FODE/BEED
	B : Looks like a few Tusken Riaders
	have campe out on the canyon dune
	turn.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

JABBA THE HUTT and the crowd watch the progress of the race
on small, hand-held view screens. JAR JAR is looking over
the shoulder of a strange alien named FANTA.

		JAR JAR
	Where's Skywalker?

FANTA moves the view screen out of Jar Jar's view. PADME,
SHMI, and QUI-GON watch another screen and look worried.

ARTOO, down in the pits with KITSTER, lets out a worried
sigh. The driver of the quadra-Pod looks worried.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

ANAKIN is powering around corners and over hills and cliffs,
passing other racers right and left. SEBULBA is in the lead.
He is being challenged by another racer, XELBREE.

SEBULBA slows a little, and as XELBREE pulls alongside, he
opens a side vent on the racer's engine and the exhaust starts
to cut through the alien's engine.

The blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES.
SEBULBA deftly veers away.

ANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they
zoom over a dune sea, kicking up dust.  His Pod shakes
violently as he goes over a jump.

One of the Podracers, ODY, catches one of his engines in the
sand, and the whole thing EXPLODES.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

QUI-GON sits quietly, meditating. PADME and SHMI search the
landscape for any sign of the racers.  JAR JAR is still
annoying FANTA for information.  The crowd SCREAMS. WATTO is
laughing with his friends, confident in Anakin's defeat.

The quadra-Pod engines start just as the racers come around
the corner. The DRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, puts it in gear, and
the four engines go off in all directions, EXPLODING in a
spectacular display. The Pod drops to the ground as SEBULBA
enters the arena, closely followed by all the OTHER RACERS.

KITSTER strains to see as ARTOO beeps excitedly. The announcer
continues.

		FODE/BEED (O.S.)
	B ; There goes Quadinaros' power
	couplings.
	A : Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata!
	(Here comes Sebulba in record time.)

QUI-GON, PADME, SHMI, and JAR JAR yell for joy as ANAKIN
passes. JAR JAR is very nervous and pounds on the back of
his alien neighbor, FANTA.

		JAR JAR
	What gooie-on?

		FANTA
	Bug off.

Lap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The
crowd stands and YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the
distance. QUI-GON and PADME look worried.

		JAR JAR
	He musta crash-ud.

		PADME
	Here he comes!

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PIT AREA - DAY (FX)

ARTOO lets out an excited whistle, as KITSTER yells.

THREEPIO : He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear!

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

Sure enough, coming around the bend is ANAKIN, quickly gaining
on the pack.

The two-headed announcer describes the action. The crowd
goes wild.

		FODE/BEED (O.S.)
	B : It looks like Skywalker is moving
	up through the field. He's in...
	A : Steeth pa nagoola!
	(Sixth place, not bad.)

ANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and
PADME is unbearable.

ODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4
stands in front of the engine and is sucked in, causing the
engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out the back of the engine,
very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze, then
EXPLODES in a puff of smoke.

		FODE/BEED (O.S.)
	A : Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda
	dunko!
	(Ody Mandrell into the pits for some
	attention.)


		ODY
	Droids!

TERTER is getting close to SEBULBA, who purposely breaks a
small part off his Pod, sending it into Terter's engine,
causing him to veer into ANAKIN, and unhooks one of the main
straps on Anakin's engines that links the Pod to his engines.
ANAKIN struggles to keep control of the little Pod. It whips
about wildly.

As the Pod swings near the broken engine strap, ANAKIN grabs
for it.

Finally, he catches the strap and manages to unhook it to
the Pod.

SEBULBA cuts the engine of OBITOKI with his side exhaust,
and the racer crashes with a cloud of dust. A THIRD RACER,
HABBA, flie into the cloud of dust and crashes into OBITOKI.
ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into the cloud of smoke. He
hits a part of one of the engines but regains control.

		FODE/BEED (O.S.)
	B :At the start of the third and
	final lap, Sebulba is in the lead,
	closely followed by Skywalker...

ANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and
neck over the rough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and
PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes through the arena. The lights
in the tower indicate that this is the third and last lap.
WATTO begins to worry.

SEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through
Anakin's engines.

ANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is
forced off course.

		FODE/BEED (O.S.)
	B : Skywalker is forced onto the
	service ramp!
	A : Oh noah!

On a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the
lead.

		FODE/BEED (O.S.)
	B : Amazing... a controlled thrust
	and he's back on course! What a move!

SEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on Anakin's tail, crowding
him and pushing him through the turns.

SEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a
difficult time keeping control. One of the parts on Anakin's
engines begins to shake loose. ANAKIN sees it and switches
over to an auxiliary system. While he is trying to accomplish
this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.

ANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move
ANAKIN makes, SEBULBA is able to block.

Finally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually
does, then tries to go around SEBULBA on the outside. They
race sid by side down the final stretch of the track.

		FODE/BEED (O.S.)
	B : He's catching Sebulba.
	A : Inkabunga.
	(Incredible!)

SEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes
into ANAKIN over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain
control as the steering rods on the two Pods become hooked
together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.

		FODE/BEED (O.S.)
	B : That little human being is out
	of his mind.
	A : Punda tah punda!
	(They're neck and neck!)
	B : They're side by side!
	A : Bongo du bongu!
	(Shoulder to shoulder!)

As they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock
the steering rods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The
strain on the steering rod is tremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN's
steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts spinning.

The release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue.
One engine EXPLODES, then the other.  SEBULBA skids through
the fire-balls, blackened, but unhurt. He slides to a smoking
stop, gets out of his racer, and throws what's left of a
shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants
are on fire, and he struggles to put them out.  ANAKIN flies
through the EXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING.  PADME
and JAR JAR jump up and down with excitment, PADME screaming
for joy. ARTOO and KITSTER whistle hysterically. QUI-GON and
SHMI smile. ANAKIN races over the finish line, the winner.

As ANAKIN stops the Podracer, KISTER turns up, and they
embrace. Hundreds of SPECTATORS join them and put ANAKIN on

Several ALIENS leave Watto's box, laughing and counting their

	knew it! I lost everything.

WATTO flies up to QUI-GON and puts his face right up against
QUI-GON's.

QUI-GON simply smiles.

		QUI-GON
	Whenever you gamble, my freind,
	eventually you'll lose. Bring the
	parts to the main hanger. I'll come
	by your shop later so you can release
	the boy.

The GROUP walks over to QUI-GON and the EOPIES.

PADME climbs on behind QUI-GON. JAR JAR swings up onto the
second EOPIE, only to slwly slide off the other side. ARTOO
whistles. ANAKIN and SHMI wave as they ride off.

		QUI-GON
	I'll return the eopies by midday.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

ARTOO cruises ahead of QUI-GON and PADME, who are riding one
of the EOPIES; JAR JAR ridses the other. They stop in front
of the sleek Naboo spacecraft.

OBI-WAN comes out of the ship and joins them.

		QUI-GON
	Start getting this hyperdrive
	generator installed. I'm going
	back...some unfinished business. I
	won't be long.

		OBI-WAN
	Why do I sense we've picked up another
	pathetic life form...?

		QUI-GON
	It's the boy who's responsible for
	getting those parts.

On a hill far overlooking the Naboo spacecraft, the SITH
PROBE DROID turns and speeds away.

EXT. TATOOINE - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

ANAKIN and A GREEDO are rolling around on the floor, fighting.
About A DOZEN OR SO KIDS are standing around them, yelling.
Suddenly, a long shadow is cast over the TWO BOYS; they stop
fighting and look up. QUI-GOMN is towering above them. KITSTER
is with them.

		QUI-GON
	What's this?

		ANAKIN
	He said I cheated.

		QUI-GON
	Did you?

		ANAKIN
	No!

		QUI-GON
	Do you still think he cheated?

		GREEDO
	Yes.

		QUI-GON
	Well, Annie. You know the truth...
	You will have to tolerate his opinion,
	fighting won't change it.

QUI-GON moves off down the street. Anakin follows. The GREEDO
wanders over to WALD who has been watching the goings-on.

		WALD
	Keep this up, Greedo, and you're
	gonna come to a bad end.

Farther down the street QUI-GON and ANAKIN head toward
Anakin's hovel.

QUI-GON takes a handful of credits from beneath his poncho
and hands them to the boy.

		QUI-GON
	These are yours. We sold the Pod.

		ANAKIN
	     (suddenly beaming))
	Yes!

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

SHMI is cleaning up as ANAKIN bursts through the door,
followed by QUI-GON.

		ANAKIN
	Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all
	the money we have!

ANAKIN pulls a bag of coins out of his pocket.

		SHMI
	Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful.

		QUI-GON
	And Anakin has been freed.

		ANAKIN
	What?!?

		QUI-GON
	You're no longer a slave.

ANAKIN jumps for joy! SHMI is stunned.

		ANAKIN
	Did you hear that, Mom?
	     (to Qui-Gon)
	Was that part of the prize, or what?

		QUI-GON
	Let's just say Watto has learned an
	important lesson about gambling.

		SHMI
	Now you can make your dreams come
	true, Annie. You're free!
	     (turns to Qui-Gon)
	Will you take him with you? Is he to
	become a Jedi?

		QUI-GON
	Our meeting was not a coincidence.
	Nothing happens by accident.
	     (to Anakin)
	You are strong with the Force, but
	you may not be accepted by the Coucil.

		ANAKIN
	A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I
	get to go with you in your starship
	and everything?!

QUI-GON kneels down to the boy.

		QUI-GON
	Anakin, training to be a Jedi will
	not be a easy challenge. And if you
	succeed, it will be a hard life.

		ANAKIN
	But it's what I want. What I've always
	dreamed about. Can I go, Mom?!

		QUI-GON
	This path has been placed for you,
	Annie; the choice to take it is yours
	alone.

ANAKIN thinks, looks to his mother, then to QUI-GON.

		ANAKIN
	I want to go.

		QUI-GON
	Then, pack your things. We haven't
	much time.

		ANAKIN
	Yipee!!

ANAKIN hugs his mom and starts for the other room, then stops.
SHMI and QUI-GON give each other a knowing look. ANAKIN has
realized something.

		ANAKIN
	What about Mom? Is she free too?
	You're coming, aren't you, Mom

		QUI-GON
	I tried to free your mother, Annie,
	but Watto wouldn't have it.

		ANAKIN
	But the money from selling...

		QUI-GON
	It's not nearly enough.

SHMI comes over to her son and sits next to him. Taking both
of his hands in hers, she draws him close.

		SHMI
	Son, my place is here. My future is
	here. It is time for you to let go...
	to let go of me. I cannot go with
	you.

		ANAKIN
	I want to stay with you. I don't
	want things to change.

		SHMI
	You can't stop change any more than
	you can stop the suns from setting.
	Listen to your feelings; Annie, you
	know what's right.

ANAKIN takes a deep breath, drops his head. QUI-GON and SHMI
exchange a look of concern.  When ANAKIN raises up, there
are tears in his eyes.

		ANAKIN
	I'm going to miss you so much, Mom...

		SHMI
	I love you, Annie... now hurry.

ANAKIN and SHMI hug. ANAKIN runs into the other room.

		SHMI
	Thank you.

		QUI-GON
	I will watch after him. You have my
	word. Will you be all right?

		SHMI
	He was in my life for such a short
	time.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - SECOND ROOM - DAY

ANAKIN has thrown the last of his things in a small backpack.
As he leaves, he stops and pushes the button that wakes his
droid up. THREEPIO stares at him blankly.

		ANAKIN
	Well, Threepio, I'm free...and I'm
	going away...in a starship...

		THREEPIO
	Master, Annie, you are my maker, and
	I wish you well. Although I'd like
	it better if I were a little less
	naked.

		ANAKIN
	I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish
	you, Threepio... give you coverings
	and all... I'm going to miss working
	on you. You've been a great pal.
	I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you
	or anything. Bye.

THREEPIO stares at ANAKIN as he rushes out of the room.

		THREEPIO
	Sell me?!?

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

KITSTER runs up to ANAKIN as he and QUI-GON exit Anakin's
hovel. SHMI stands in the doorway. ANAKIN pulls a handful of
coins out of his pocket and gives them to KITSTER.

		KITSTER
	There are so many of us who want you
	to stay, Annie... You're a hero.

		ANAKIN
	I...
	     (looks to Shmi)
	I... have to go.

QUI-GON has moved a short way down the street.

		KITSTER
	Well.

		ANAKIN
	 Well.

		KITSTER
	Thank's for every moment you've been
	here. You're my best friend.

		ANAKIN
	I won't forget.

ANAKIN hugs KITSTER and runs toward QUI-GON, then stops to
look back at his mother standing in the doorway. He turns
back to QUI-GON, then turns and runs back to his mother.

		ANAKIN
	     (starting to cry)
	I can't do it, Mom. I just can't.

SHMI hugs ANAKIN. QUI-GON watches from the distance. She
kneels down and looks him in the face.

		SHMI
	Annie, remember when you climbed the
	great dune in order to chase the
	Banthas away so they wouldn't be
	shot... Remember how you collapses
	several times, exhausted thinking
	you couldn't do it?

ANAKIN shakes his head.

		SHMI
	This is one of those times when you
	have to do something you don't think
	you can do. I know how strong you
	are, Annie. I know you can do this...

		ANAKIN
	Will I ever see you again?

		SHMI
	What does your heart tell you?

		ANAKIN
	I hope so...yes...I guess.

		SHMI
	Then we will see each other again.

		ANAKIN
	I.. will become a Jedi and I will
	come back and free you, Mom... I
	promise.

		SHMI
	No matter where you are, my love
	will be with you. Now be brave, and
	don't look back... don't look back.

		ANAKIN
	I love you so much.

SHMI hugs ANAKIN, then turns him around so he is facing QUI-
GON, and off he marches, like the brave little trooper that
he is. He marches right past QUI-GON, starring right ahead,
tears in his eyes, determined not to look back.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - DAY

The PROBE DROID beeps and whistles to DARTH MAUL. The SITH
LORD gets on a speeder bike and follows the PROBE DROID into
Mos Espa.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN and QUI-GON exit WATTO'S and stop before JIRA'S fruit
stand. ANAKIN hands JIRA some coins.

		ANAKIN
	I've been freed, and I'm going away.
	Buy yourself a cooling unit with
	this... Otherwise I'll worry about
	you.

JIRA is astonished. She stares, not knowing what to say.

		JIRA
	Can I give you a hug?

		ANAKIN
	Sure.

She gives him a hug.

		JIRA
	I'll miss you, Annie... there isn't
	a kinder boy in the galaxy. You be
	careful...

ANAKIN runs to join QUI-GON, who has already started down
the street. As they walk along together, QUI-GON notices
something out of the corner of his eye.  Suddenly, without
breaking his stride, he ignites his laser sword, swing around,
and lunges forward and cuts a lurking PROBE DROID in half.
QUI-GON inspects the sparking and fizzing DROID.

		ANAKIN
	What is it?

		QUI-GON
	Probe droid. Very unusual... not
	like anything I've seen before.

Come on.

QUI-GON and ANAKIN start running.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON and ANAKIN run toward the Naboo spacecraft. ANAKIN
is having a hard time keeping up.

		ANAKIN
	Master Qui-Gon,sir, wait!

QUI-GON turns to answer and sees a DARK-CLOAKED FIGURE bearing
down on a speeder bike.

		QUI-GON
	Anakin, drop!

ANAKIN drops to the ground just as DARTH MAUL sweeps over
him. DARTH MAUL jumps off his speeder bike, and before he
has hit the ground, the Sith Lord has swund a death blow
with his laser sword that is barely blocked by QUI-GON.

ANAKIN picks himself up. The two galactic warriors, Sith and
Jedi, are bashing each other with incredible blows. They
move in a continual cloudof dust, smashing everything around
them. This is a fierce fight. ANAKIN gets up, bewildered by
the confrontation.

		QUI-GON
	Annie, get to the ship! Take off!
	Go! Go!

QUI-GON struggles to fend off the relentless onslaught as
ANAKIN races to the ship.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY

ANAKIN runs into the main hallway of the spaceship, where
PADME and Capt. Panaka are working.

		ANAKIN
	Qui-Gon's in trouble. He says to
	take off...now!!

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Who are you?

		PADME
	He's a friend.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

Capt. Panaka, ANAKIN, and PADME rush into the cockpit where
OBI-WAN and RIC OLIE are checking the hyperdrive.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Qui-Gon is in trouble, he says to
	take off!

		PILOT
	I don't see anything.

		OBI-WAN
	Over there! Fly low!

In the distance is a small cloud of dust.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL continue theirsword battle. Leaping
over one another in an incredible display of acrobatics, the
two warrios hear the ship fly over them a few feet off the
ground. QUI-GON almost dissapears for a moment.  Before DARTH
MAUL knows what's happening, QUI-GON is on the spacecrat's
ramp.

EXT. TATOOINE - NABOO SPACECRAFT RAMP - DAY

The SITH LORD immediately jumps onto the ramp after QUI-GON,
but barely makes it. His heels hang over the edge of a forty-
foot drop. QUI-GON swings his laser sword with all his might
and knocks DARTH AMUL off the ramp and onto the desert floor.
The ramp closes, and the Naboo craft rockets away, leaving
the Sith Lord standing alone.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The sleek spacecraft rockets away from the planet Tatooine.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN rush into the hallway to find QUI-GON
collapsed on the floor opposite the entry.  ARTOO is looking
over him. The JEDI is breathing hard, wet with sweat and
covered in dirt.

		ANAKIN
	Are you all right?

		QUI-GON
	I think so... that was a surpirse I
	wont soon forget.

		OBI-WAN
	What was it?

		QUI-GON
	I don't know... but he was well
	trained in the Jedi arts. My guess
	is he was after the Queen...

		ANAKIN
	Do you think he'll follow us?

		QUI-GON
	We'll be safe enough once we're in
	hyperspace, but I have no doubt he
	knows our destination.

		ANAKIN
	What are we going to do about it?

OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a "who are you?" look. ANAKIN returns
an innocent stare.

		QUI-GON
	We will be patient. Anakin Skywalker,
	meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

		ANAKIN
	Pleased to meet you. Wow! You're a
	Jedi too?

OBI-WAN gives the boy a skeptical look.

INT. COCKPIT - SPACE

RIC OLIE pulls back on the hyperdrive. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and
ANAKIN watch.

		QUI-GON
	Let's hope this hyperdrive works and
	Watto didn't get the last laugh.

The stars streak outside the cockpit window.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The ship streaks into hyperspace.

EXT. THEED - STREET - NIGHT (FX)

SEVERAL FEDERATION DROIDS patrol a deserted city street. The
Palace can be seen in the distance.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT

NUTE sits in a strange, mechanical walking chair, which
approaches SIO BIBBLE and SEVERAL OTHER NABOO OFFICIALS.
RUNE follows a few paces behind.

DROID GUARDS surround SIO BIBBLE and THE OTHERS as FOUR
COUNCIL MEMBERS watch.

		NUTE
	When are you going to give up this
	pointless strike? Your Queen is lost,
	your people are starving, and you,
	Governor, are going to die, much
	sooner than your people, I'm afraid.
	Take him away!

		BIBBLE
	This invasion will gain you nothing.
	We're a democracy. The people have
	decided... They will not live under
	your tyranny.

BIBBLE is taken away as OOM-9 approaches NUTE.

		OOM-9
	My troops are in position to begin
	searching the swamps for these rumored
	underwater villages... they will not
	stay hidden for long.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

The ship is asleep. The lights are dim as PADME walks into
the main room.

She goes to a monitor and watches the BIBBLE plea recording.
JAR JAR is stretched out on the floor, snoring. ARTOO is to
one side, cooing as he rests.

PADME appears tired. She senses someone watching her and
turns around with a start. She sees ANAKIN sitting in the
corner, shivering and looking verydejected. She goes over to
him. He looks up at her with tears in his eyes. He is holding
his arms to keep himself warm.

		PADME
	Are you all right?

		ANAKIN
	It's very cold.

PADME gives him her over-jacket.

		PADME
	You're from a warm planet, Annie.
	Too warm for my taste. Space is cold.

		ANAKIN
	You seem sad.

		PADME
	The Queen is...worried. Her people
	are suffering...dying. She must
	convince the Senate to intervene,
	or...I'm not sure what will happen.

		ANAKIN
	I'm...I'm not sure what's going to
	happen to me. I dunno if I'll ever
	see you again..
	     (he pulls something
	     from his pocket)
	I made this for you. Sou you'd
	remember me. I carved it out of a
	japor snippet... It will bring you
	good fortune.

ANAKIN hands a wooden pendant to PADME. She inspects it,
then puts it around her neck.

		PADME
	It's beautiful, but I don't need
	this to remember you. Many things
	will change when we reach the capital,
	Annie. My caring for you will always
	remain.

		ANAKIN
	I care for you too. Only I...miss...

ANAKIN is disturbed about something. Tears are in his eyes.

		PADME
	...You miss your mother.

ANAKIN looks at her, unable to speak. She hugs him.

EXT. SPACE - PLANET CORUSCANT (FX)

MOVE with the ship as it heads toward Coruscant.

INT. CORUSCANT - CITYSCAPE - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX)

The spacecraft dlies over the endlesscityscape of Coruscant,
the capital of the galaxy.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

ANAKIN looks out the cockpit window in awe.

		RIC OLIE
	Coruscant...the capital of the
	Republic...the entire planet is one
	big city.

		ANAKIN
	Wow! It's so huge!

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX)

The ship flies through the cityscape of Coruscant.

EXT. CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - DAY

Supreme Chancellor VALORUM, SEVERAL GUARDS, and SENATOR
PALPATINE stand on a landing platform.

The sleek Naboo spacecraft lands on the platform high above
the street level of the galactic capital. The ramp lowers.
OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, JAR JAR and ANAKIN descend the ramp first
and bow before PALPATINE and VALORUM.

Capt. Panaka, TWO GUARDS, QUEEN AMIDALA, then PADME, RABE,
EIRTAE, and MORE GUARDS descend the ramp. QUEEN AMIDALA stops
before the group.

ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand to one side, looking at the huge
city. PADME smiles at ANAKIN. PALPATINE bows before the Queen.

		PALPATINE
	It is a great gift to see you alive,
	Your Majesty. May I present Supreme
	Chancellor Valorum.

		VALORUM
	Welcome, Your Highness. It is an
	honor to finally meet you in person.
	I must relay to you how distressed
	everyone is over the currant
	situation. I've called for a special
	session of the Senate to hear your
	position.

		AMIDALA
	I am grateful for your concern,
	Chancellor.

PALPATINE starts to lead QUEEN AMIDALA and her RETINUE off
the platform toward a waiting air taxi.

		PALPATINE
	There is a question of precedure,
	but I feel confident we can overcome
	it...

JAR JAR and ANAKIN start to follow, then stop, noticing that
OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are staying with the SUPREME CHANCELLOR.
QUEEN AMIDALA waves to the duo to follow her.  ANAKIN looks
back to QUI-GON, and he nods to go ahead.

ANAKIN and JAR JAR join the QUEEN, PALPATINE, PADME, RABE
and EIRTAE in the taxi. PALPATINE gives the Gungan and the
boy in the back of the taxi a skeptical look. JAR JAR leans
over to ANAKIN.

		JAR JAR
	Da Queens- a bein grossly nice, mesa
	tinks.
	     (he looks around)
	Pitty hot!

VALORUM and the JEDI watch the taxi move off into the city.

		QUI-GON
	I must speak with the Jei Council
	immediately, Your Honor. The situation
	has become more complicated.

INT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - ANTEROOM - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA is sitting listening to PALPATINE. EIRTAE and
RABE stand behind the QUEEN; PADME is nowhere to be sen.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR are waiting in an adjoining room. They
can see the Queen but cannot hear what is being said.

		JAR JAR
	Dissen all pitty odd to my.

		ANAKIN
	Don't look at me. I don't know what's
	going on.

Capt. Panaka enters, then goes into the room with QUEEN
AMIDALA.

INT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - LIVING AREA - DAY

PALPATINE is pacing as Capt. Panaka enters. EIRTAE and RABE
stand to one side.

		PALPATINE
	...the Republic is not what it once
	was. The Senate is full of greedy,
	squabbling delegates who are only
	looking out for themselves and their
	home sytems.  There is no interest
	in the common good...no civility,
	only politics...its disgusting. I
	must be frank, Your Majesty, there
	is little chance the Senate will act
	on the invasion.

		AMIDALA
	Chancellor Valorum seems to think
	there is hope.

		PALPATINE
	If I may say so, Your Majesty, the
	Chancellor has little real power...he
	is mired down by baseless accusations
	of corruption. A manufactured scandal
	surrounds him. The bureaucrats are
	in charge now.

		AMIDALA
	What options do we have?

		PALPATINE
	Our best choice would be to push for
	the election of a stronger Supreme
	Chancellor. One who will take control
	of the bureaucrats, enforces the
	laws, and give us justice. You could
	call for a vote of no confidence in
	Chancellor Valorum.

		AMIDALA
	He has been our strongest supporter.
	Is there any other way?

		PALPATINE
	Our only other choice would to be to
	submit a plea to the courts...

		AMIDALA
	There's no time for that. The courts
	take even longer to decide things
	than the Senate. Our people are dying,
	Senator...more and more each day. We
	must do something quickly to stop
	the Federation.

		PALPATINE
	To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd
	say we're going to have to accept
	Federation control for the time being.

		AMIDALA
	There is something I cannot do.

EXT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - DAY (FX)

A unique building with it tall spires stands out against the
Coruscant skyline. A small transport passes by the vast
temple.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY

QUI-GON stands in a tall stately room. Twelve JEDI sit in a
semi-circle.  OBI-WAN stands behind QUI-GON in the center of
the room.

The Senior Jedi is MACE WINDU. To his left is an alien Jedi
named KI-ADI-MUNDI, and to his right, the Jedi Master, YODA.

		QUI-GON
	...my only conclusion can be that it
	was a Sith Lord.

		MACE WINDU
	A Sith Lord?!?

		KI-ADI
	Impossible! The Sith have been extinct
	for a millenium.

		YODA
	The very Republic is threatened, if
	involved the Sith are.

		MACE WINDU
	I do not believe they could have
	returned without us knowing.

		YODA
	Hard to see, the dark side is.
	Discover who this assassin is, we
	must.

		KI-ADI
	I sense he will reveal himself again.

		MACE WINDU
	This attack was with purpose, that
	is clear, and I agree the Queen is
	the target.

		YODA
	With this Naboo queen you must stay,
	Qui-Gon. Protect her.

		MACE WINDU
	We will use all our resources here
	to unravel this mystery and discover
	the identity of your attacker... May
	the Force be with you.

		YODA
	May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN turns to leave, but QUI-GON continues to face the
Council.

		YODA
	Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?

		QUI-GON
	With your permission, my Master. I
	have encountered a vergence in the
	Force.

		YODA
	A vergence, you say?

		MACE WINDU
	Located around a person?

		QUI-GON
	A boy... his cells have the highest
	concentration of midi-chlorians I
	have seen in a life form. It is
	possible he was conceived by the
	midi-chlorians.

		MACE WINDU
	You're referring to the prophesy of
	the one who will bring balance to
	the Force...you believe it's this
	boy??

		QUI-GON
	I don't pressume...

		YODA
	But you do! Rrevealed your opinion
	is.

		QUI-GON
	I request the boy be tested.

The JEDI all look to one another. They nod and turn back to
OBI-WAN and QUI-GON.

		YODA
	Trained as a Jedi, you request for
	him?

		QUI-GON
	Finding him was the will of the
	Force...I have no doubt of that.

There is too much happening here...

		MACE WINDU
	Bring him before us, then.

		YODA
	Tested he will be.

INT. QUEENS QUARTERS - CORUSCANT - DAY

Anakin, tentative, walks down one of the long hallways in
Senator Palpatine's quarters. He stops before a dor that is
flanked by TWO GUARDS.

		GUARD
	May I help you, son?

		ANAKIN
	I'm...I'm looking for the handmaiden,
	Padme.

The GUARD speaks into his comlink as ANAKIN looks around a
bit nervously.

		GUARD
	The boy is here to see Padme.

		RABE
	Send him in.

The doors open, and ANAKIN enters the Queen's quarters.

RABE greets ANAKIN as TWO OTHER HANDMAIDENS come and go into
the next room.

		ANAKIN
	I'd like to speak with Padme, if I
	could.

		RABE
	I'm sorry, Annie. Padme is not here
	right now.

The Queen speaks out in the next room.

		AMIDALA (O.S.)
	Who is it?

		RABE
	Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your
	Highness.

The QUEEN moves into the doorway and studies ANAKIN. ANAKIN
bows and looks down, then takes a peek at her.

		AMIDALA
	I've sent Padme on an errand.

		ANAKIN
	I'm going to the Jedi temple to start
	my training, I hope.

The QUEEN just stares at him.

		ANAKIN
	I may not see her again... and... I
	just wanted to say goodbye.

		AMIDALA
	We will tell her for you. We're sure
	her heart goes with you.

ANAKIN bows again.

		ANAKIN
	Thank you, Your Highness. I'm sorry
	to have disturbed you.

The QUEEN dissapears behind the doorway, and ANAKIN exits.

EXT. CORUSCANT - GALACTIC SENATE BUILDING - DAY (FX)

A large, distinctive looking domed building stands out amid
the cityscape of Coruscant.

INT. MAIN ROTUNDA - GALACTIC SENATE - DAY

The Senate chambers are huge. Thousands of SENATORS and their
AIDES sit in the circular assembly area. CHANCELLOR VALORUM
sits in an elevated area in the center. Hindreds of AIDES
and DROIDS hurry about. SENATOR PALPATINE, QUEEN AMIDALA,
EIRTA, RABE, and Capt. Panaka sit in the Naboo congressional
box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE leans
over to the QUEEN.

		PALPATINE
	If the Federation moves to defer the
	motion...Your Majesty, Ibeg of you
	to ask for a resolution to end this
	congressional session.

		AMIDALA
	I wish I had your confidence in this,
	Senator.

		PALPATINE
	You must force a new election for
	Supreme Chancellor... I promise you
	there are many who will support us...
	it is our best chance... Your Majesty,
	our only, chance.

		AMIDALA
	You truely believe Chancellor Valorum
	will not bring our motion to a vote?

		PALPATINE
	He is distracted...he is afraid. He
	will be of no help.

		VALORUM
	The Chair recognizes the Senator
	from the sovereign system of Naboo.

The Naboo congressional box floats into the center.

		PALPATINE
	Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the
	Senate. A tragedy has occured on our
	peaceful system of Naboo. We have
	become caugt in a dispute you're all
	well aware of, which began right
	here with the taxation of trade
	routes, and has now engulfed our
	entire planet in the oppresion of
	the Trade Federation.

A second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is
filled with Federation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the
Senator for the Federation.

		LOTT DOD
	This is outrageous! I object to the
	Senator's statements!

		VALORUM
	The Chair does not recognize the
	Senator from the Trade Federation at
	this time. Please return to your
	station.

LOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.

		PALPATINE
	To state our allegations, I present
	Queen Amidala, the recently elected
	ruler of Naboo, to speak on our
	behalf.

QUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is
some applause.

		AMIDALA
	Honorable representatives of the
	Republic, distinguished delegates,
	and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor
	Valorum, I come to you under the
	gravest of circumstances. The Naboo
	system has been invaded by force.
	Invaded...against all the laws of
	the Republic by the Droid Armies of
	the Trade...

		LOTT DOD
	I object! There is no proof. This is
	incredible. We recommend a commision
	be sent to Naboo to assertain the
	truth.

		VALORUM
	Overruled.

		LOTT DOD
	Your Honor, you cannot allow us to
	be condemned without reasonable
	observation. It's against all the
	rules of procedure.

A third box representing Malastare moves into the center of
the room. AKS MOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.

		AKS MOE
	The Congress of Malastare concurs
	with the honorable delegate from the
	Trade Federation. A commision must
	be appointed...that is the law.

		VALORUM
	The point...

VALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN
MAS AMEDDA.

PALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.

		PALPATINE
	Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers
	of the Republic, and on the payroll
	of the Trade Federation, I might
	add. This is where Chancellor
	Valorum's strength will dissapear.

		VALORUM
	The point is conceded...Section 523A
	take precedence here. Queen Amidala
	of the Naboo, will you defer your
	motion to allow a commission to
	explore the validity of your
	accusations?

QUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.

		AMIDALA
	     (angrily)
	I will not defer... I have come before
	you to resolve this attack on our
	sovereignty now.  I was not elected
	to watch my people suffer and die
	while you discuss this invasion in a
	committee. If this body is not capable
	of action, I suggest new leadership
	is needed. I move for a "vote of no
	confidence"...in Chancellor Valorum's
	leadership.

		VALORUM
	What?...No!

This causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud mumur
cresendos into a roar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR
VALORUM is stunned and stands speechless. His Vice Chair,
MAS AMEDDA, takes over.

		MAS AMEDDA
	Order! We shall have order...

Things settledown a little. The Federation box settles next
to AMIDALA.

PRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena.

		BAIL ORGANA
	Alderaan seconds the motion for a
	vote of no confidence in Chancellor
	Valorum.

		MAS AMEDDA
	The motion has been seconded by Bail
	Organa of Alderaan.

MAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers
something to him.

		BAIL ORGANA
	There must be no delays. The motion
	is on the floor and must be voted
	upon in this session.

		LOTT DOD
	The Trade Federation moves the motion
	be sent to the procedures committee
	for study.

The assembly begins to chant. VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA.

		ASSEMBLY
	Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!

PALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.

		PALPATINE
	You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is
	with us... Valorum will be voted
	out, I assure you, and they will
	elect in a new Chancellor, a strong
	Chancellor, one who will not let our
	tragedy continue...

		MAS AMEDDA
	The Supreme Chancellor requests a
	recess. Tomorrow we will begin the
	vote.

The Federation delegation is furious. VALORUM turns to
PALPATINE.

		VALORUM
	Palpatine, I thought you were my
	ally...my friend. You have betrayed
	me! How could you do this?

EXT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - BALCONY - SUNSET

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand outside the palace on a balcony.

		OBI-WAN
	The boy will not pass the Council's
	tests, Master, and you know it. He
	is far too old.

		QUI-GON
	Anakin will become A Jedi... I promise
	you.

		OBI-WAN
	Don't defy the Council, Master..not
	again.

		QUI-GON
	I will do what I must.

		OBI-WAN
	Master, you could be sitting on the
	Council by now if you would just
	follow the code. They will not go
	along with you this time.

		QUI-GON
	You still have much to learn, my
	young apprentice.

INT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - SUNSET

ANAKIN stands before the TWELVE JEDI. MACE WINDU holds a
small hand-held viewing screen. In rapid succession, images
flash across the screen.

		ANAKIN
	A ship...a cup...a speeder.

MACE WINDU turns the viewing screen off and nods toward YODA.

		YODA
	Good, good, young one. How feel you?

		ANAKIN
	Cold, sir.

		YODA
	Afraid are you?

		ANAKIN
	No, sir.

		MACE WINDU
	Afraid to give up your life?

		ANAKIN
	I don't think so.

ANAKIN hesitates for a moment.

		YODA
	See through you, we can.

		MACE WINDU
	Be mindful of your feelings...

		KI-ADI
	YOur thoughts dwell on your mother.

		ANAKIN
	I miss her.

		YODA
	Afraid to lose her..I think.

		ANAKIN
	     (a little angry)
	What's that got to do with anything?

		YODA
	Eveything. Fear is the path to the
	dark side... fear leads to anger...
	anger leads to hate.. hate leads to
	suffering.

		ANAKIN
	     (angrily)
	I am not afraid!

		YODA
	A Jedi must have the deepest
	commitment, the most serious mind. I
	sense much fear in you.

		ANAKIN
	     (quietly)
	I am not afraid.

		YODA
	Then continue, we will.

INT. PALPATINES QUARTERS - SUNSET

QUEEN AMIDALA is standing, staring out the window, with JAR
JAR. The lights of the city shimmer before them. EIRTAE and
SABE stand near the door. JAR JAR turns to face the QUEEN
and sees her sadness.

		JAR JAR
	Mesa wonder why da guds invent pain?

		AMIDALA
	To motivate us, I imagine...

		JAR JAR
	Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?

		AMIDALA
	I don't know.

		JAR JAR
	Gungans ganna get pasted too, eh?

		AMIDALA
	I hope not.

		JAR JAR
	Gungans do die'n without a fight....
	wesa warriors. Wesa gotta grand army.
	Dat why you no liken us, metinks.

PALPATINE and Capt. Panaka rush into the rom and bow before
the QUEEN.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has
	been nominated to succeed Valorum as
	Supreme Chancellor.

		PALPATINE
	A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome
	one. I promise, Your Majesty, if I
	am elected, I will bring democracy
	back to the Republic. I will put an
	end to corruption.  The Trade
	Fedreation will lose its influence
	over the bureaucrats, and our people
	will be freed.

		AMIDALA
	Who else can be nominated?

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee
	Teem of Malastare.

		PALPATINE
	I feel confident...our "situation"
	will create a strong sympaphy vote
	for us... I will be Chancellor, I
	promise you.

		AMIDALA
	I fear by the time you have control
	of the bureaucrats, Senator, there
	will be nothing left of our cities,
	our people, our way of life...

		PALPATINE
	I understand your concern, Your
	Majesty; unfortunately, the Federation
	has possession of our planet. The
	law is in their favor.

		AMIDALA
	With the Senate in transition, there
	is nothing more I can do
	here...Senator, this is your arena.
	I feel I must return to mine. I have
	decided to go back to Naboo. My place
	is with my people.

		PALPATINE
	Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be
	realistic! You would be in danger.
	They will force you to sign the
	treaty.

		AMIDALA
	I will sign no treaty, Senator. My
	fate will be no different from that
	of our people. Captain!

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Yes, Your Highness?

		AMIDALA
	Ready my ship!

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Please, Your Majesty, stay
	here...where it's safe.

		AMIDALA
	No place is safe, if the Senate
	doesn't condemn this invasion. It is
	clear to me now that the Republic no
	longer functions as a democracy. If
	you win the election, Senator, I
	know you will do everything possible
	to stop the Federation. I pray you
	will bring sanity and compassion
	back to the Senate.

AMIDALA and her RETINUE exit the room. PALPATINE has a self-
satisfied smile on his face.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - TWILIGHT

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON stand before the TWELVE MEMBERS
OF THE JEDI COUNCIL.

		YODA
	...Correct you were, Qui-Gon.

		MACE WINDU
	His cells contain a high concentration
	of midi-chlorians.

		KI-ADI
	The Force is strong with him.

		QUI-GON
	He's to be trained, then.

The COUNCIL MEMBERS look to one another.

		MACE WINDU
	No. He will not be trained.

ANAKIN is crestfallen; tears begin to form in his eyes.

		QUI-GON
	No??!!

OBI-WAN smiles.

		MACE WINDU
	He is too old. There is already too
	much anger in him.

		QUI-GON
	He is the chosen one...you must see
	it.

		YODA
	Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked
	by his youth.

		QUI-GON
	I will train him, then. I take Anakin
	as my Padawan learner.

OBI-WAN reacts with surprise. ANAKIN watches with interest.

		YODA
	An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon.
	Impossible, to take on a second.

		MACE WINDU
	We forbid it.

		QUI-GON
	Obi-Wan is ready...

		OBI-WAN
	I am ready to face the trials.

		YODA
	Ready so early, are you? What know
	you of ready?

ANAKIN watches as QUI-GON and OBI-WAN exchange angry looks.

		QUI-GON
	Headstrong....and he has much to
	learn about the living Force, but he
	is capabe. There is little more he
	will learn from me.

		YODA
	Our own council we will keep on who
	is ready. More to learn, he has...

		MACE WINDU
	Now is not the time for this...the
	Senate is voting for a new Spreme
	Chancellor. Queen Amidala is returning
	home, which will put pressure on the
	Federation, and could widen the
	confrontation.

		YODA
	And draw out the Queen's attacker.

		KI-ADI
	Events are moving fast...too fast.

		MACE WINDU
	Go with the Queen to Naboo and
	discover the identity of the dark
	warrior.  That is the clue we need
	to unravel this mystery of the Sith.

		YODA
	Young Skywalker's fate will be decided
	later.

		QUI-GON
	I brought Anakin here; he must stay
	in my charge. He has nowhere else to
	go.

		MACE WINDU
	He is your ward, Qui-Gon...we will
	not dispute that.

		YODA
	Train him not. Take him with you,
	but train him not!

		MACE WINDU
	Protect the Queen, but do not
	intercede if it comes to war until
	we have the Senate's approval.

		YODA
	May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN leave.

EXT. CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - NIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and ANAKIN stand on the landing platform
outside the ship. ARTOO whistles a happy tune as he leans
over the edge of the platform, watching the traffic. Suddenly,
he leans over too far and falls overboard. After a moment,
he reappears, using his on-board jets to propel himself back
onto the landing platform. The wind whips at ANAKIN as he
listens to the JEDI.

		OBI-WAN
	It is not disrespect, Master, it is
	the truth.

		QUI-GON
	From your point of view....

		OBI-WAN
	The boy is dangerous...they all sense
	it. Why can't you?

		QUI-GON
	His fate is uncertain, not dangerous.
	The Council will decide Anakin's
	future...that should be enough for
	you. Now get on board!

OBI-WAN reluctantly boards the Naboo spacecraft followed by
ARTOO. QUI-GON goes over to ANAKIN.

		ANAKIN
	Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish
	to be a problem.

		QUI-GON
	You won't be, Annie....I'm not allowed
	to train you, so I want you to watch
	me and be mindful...always remember,
	your focus determines your reality.
	Stay close to me and you will be
	safe.

		ANAKIN
	Master, sir... I've been wondering...
	what are midi-chlorians?

		QUI-GON
	Midi-chlorians are a microcopic
	lifeform that reside within all living
	cells and communicates with the Force.

		ANAKIN
	They live inside of me?

		QUI-GON
	In your cells. We are symbionts with
	the midi-chlorians.

		ANAKIN
	Symbionts?

		QUI-GON
	Life forms living together for mutual
	advantage. Without the midi-chlorians,
	life could not exist, and we would
	have no knowledge of the Force. They
	continually speak to you, telling
	you the will of the Force.

		ANAKIN
	They do??

		QUI-GON
	When you learn to quiet your mind,
	you will hear them speaking to you.

		ANAKIN
	I don't understand.

		QUI-GON
	With time and training, Annie...you
	will.

Two taxis pull up, and Capt. Panaka, SENATOR PALPATINE, TWENTY
OR SO TROOPS, GUARDS, and OFFICERS walk briskly toward the
ship, followed by QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTAE, and finally,
JAR JAR. AMIDALA and her HANDMAIDENS stop before the JEDI.

		QUI-GON
	Your Highness, it is our pleasure to
	continue to serve and protect you.

		AMIDALA
	I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine
	fears the Federation means to destroy
	me.

		QUI-GON
	I promise you, I will not let that
	happen.

AMIDALA enters the ship, followed by her HANDMAIDENS. JAR
JAR hugs QUI-GON and ANAKIN.

		JAR JAR
	Wesa goen home!

They ALL move onto the ship. The ship takes off.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	The Queen is on her way to you. I
	regret she is of no further use to
	us. When she gets there, destroy
	her.

		NUTE
	Yes, my Lord.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	Viceroy, is the planet secure?

		NUTE
	Yes, my Lord, we have taken over the
	last pockets of primitive life forms.
	We are in complete control of the
	planet now.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	Good. I will see to it that in the
	Senate, things stay as they are.  I
	am sending Darth Maul to join you.
	He will deal with the Jedi.

		NUTE
	Yes, my Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades off.

		RUNE
	A Sith lord here with us?!!

INT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT COCKPIT

ANAKIN stands next to the PILOT, RIC OLIE, pointing to various
buttons and gauges.

		ANAKIN
	...and that one?

		RIC OLIE
	The forward stabalizer.

		ANAKIN
	And those control the pitch?

		RIC OLIE
	You catch on pretty quick.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEEN'S CHAMBERS

SABE and EIRTAE stand behind QUEEN AMIDALA as she talks with
QUI-GON and Capt. Panaka. OBI-WAN and JAR JAR watch.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	The moment we land the Federation
	will arrest you, and force you to
	sign the treaty.

		QUI-GON
	I agree... I'm not sure what you
	hope to accomplish by this.

		AMIDALA
	I'm going to take back what's ours.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	There are only twelve of us, Your
	Highness....we have no army.

		QUI-GON
	I cannot fight a war for you, Your
	Highness, only protect you.

		AMIDALA
	Jar Jar Binks!

JAR JAR looks around, puzzled.

		JAR JAR
	Mesa, Your Highness?

		AMIDALA
	Yes. I need your help.

INT. NABOO CRUISER COCKPIT - DAY

The Naboo Cruiser heads toward the lush green planet. There
is only one Federation battle cruiser orbiting. OBI-WAN and
Capt. Panaka spot it on the view screen.

		PANAKA
	The blockade's gone.

		OBI-WAN
	The war's over...No need for it now.

		RIC OLIE
	I have one battleship on my scope.

		OBI-WAN
	A droid control ship.

		PANAKA
	They've probably spotted us.

		OBI-WAN
	We haven't much time.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN HOLD

The QUEEN, Capt. Panaka, TROOPS, and HANDMAIDENS get ready
to disembark as the ship alnds. The elevator door slides
open, and ANAKIN emerges into the hold area.  He see PADME
and run up to her.

		ANAKIN
	Hi! Where have you been?

		PADME
	Annie! What are you doing here?

		ANAKIN
	I'm with Qui-Gon... but... they're
	not going to let me be a Jedi.  I'm
	too old.

		PADME
	This is going to be dangerous, Annie.

		ANAKIN
	Is it? I can help... Where are we
	going?

		PADME
	To war, I'm afraid. The Queen has
	had to make the most difficuld
	decision of her life. She doesn't
	believe in fighting, Annie. We are a
	peaceful people...

		ANAKIN
	I want to help...I'm glad you're
	back.

ANAKIN smiles. PADME smiles back.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - DAY

The Naboo spacecraft has landed in the Gungan swamp. TROOPS
unload the ships in the background as OBI-WAN approaches QUI-
GON.

		OBI-WAN
	Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan
	city, Master.

QUI-GON's thoughts are elsewhere.

		QUI-GON
	Good.

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand silently for a moment.

		OBI-WAN
	Do you think the Queen's idea will
	work?

		QUI-GON
	The Gungans will not easily be swayed,
	and we cannot use our power to help
	her.

		OBI-WAN
	I'm... I'm sorry for my behavior,
	Master. It is not my place to disagree
	with you about the boy. I am grateful
	you think I am ready for the trials.

QUI-GON looks at him for a long moment.

		QUI-GON
	You have been a good apprentice. You
	are much wiser than I am, Obi-Wan.
	I foresee you will become a great
	Jedi Knight.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - UNDERWATER - DAY (FX)

JAR JAR swims down into Bubble City.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE

JAR JAR enters the main square of the bubble city. He stands,
stunned, in amazement and fear. He is nervous and shaking.

		JAR JAR
	Ello! Where das everybody?

The plaza is empty. He notices that many of the buildings
are shot up as if there had been a battle of some kind.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - DAY

JAR JAR exits the swamp lake and walks over to QUEEN AMIDALA,
Capt. Panaka, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON. PADME, EIRTAE, RABE,
ANAKIN, and ARTOO, FOUR PILOTS, and EIGHT GUARDS stand in
the background near the starship.

		JAR JAR
	Dare-sa nobody dare. All gone. Some
	kinda fight, I tink. Sorry, no
	Gungas...no Gungas.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Do you think they have been taken to
	camps?

		OBI-WAN
	More likely they were wiped out.

		JAR JAR
	No... mesa no tink so. Gungan hiden.
	When in trouble, go to sacred place.
	Mackineeks no find them dare.

		QUI-GON
	Do you know where they are?

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - DAY

The GROUP follows JAR JAR as he moves through the swamp. JAR
JAR stops and sniffs the air. The GROUP stop behind him.

		JAR JAR
	Dissen it.

JAR JAR makes a strange chattering noise. Suddenly, out of
nowhere, CAPTAIN TARPALS and SIX OTHER GUNGAN TROOPS riding
on KAADUS emerge from the brush.

		JAR JAR
	Heyo-dalee, Captain Tarpals.

		CAPT. TARPALS
	Binks!! Noah gain!

		JAR JAR
	We comen to see da boss.

CAPTIAN TARPALS rolls his eyes.

		CAPT. TARPALS
	Ouch time, Binks... Ouch time for
	all-n youse.

EXT. NABOO SACRED TEMPLE RUINS - DAY

JAR JAR, QUEEN AMIDALA, ANAKIN, ARTOO, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN,
PADME, RABE,

EIRTAE, and the rest of her group are led through a clearing
full of GUNGAN refugees.  At the far end are the ruins of a
grand temple with massive carved heads. BOSS NASS and several
other COUNCIL MEMBERS walk out on the top of a three-quarter-
submerged head.

		BOSS NASS
	Jar Jar, yousa payen dis time. Who's
	da uss-en others??

QUEEN AMIDALA steps forward. Capt. Panaka and the JEDI stand
behind her.

		AMIDALA
	I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo...I
	come before you in peace.

		BOSS NASS
	Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da
	Mackineeks... Dya busten uss-en omm.
	Yousa all bombad. Yousa all die'n,
	mesa tink.

Capt. Panaka and HALF A DOZEN GUARDS and PILOTS look around
nervously, and the GUNGAN TROOPS lower their long power poles.
The JEDI stay relaxed.

ANAKIN watches everything with great interest.

		AMIDALA
	We wish to form an alliance...

Suddenly, PADME steps forward.

		PADME
	Your Honor...

ARTOO whistles a quiet "uh oh."

		BOSS NASS
	Whosa dis?

		PADME
	I am Queen Amidala
	     (points to Queen)
	This is my decoy... my protection...
	my loyal bodyguard.

ANAKIN is stunned. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON give each other a
knowing look.

		PADME
	...I am sorry for my deception, but
	under the circumstances it has become
	necessary to protect myself. Although
	we do not always agree, Your Honor,
	our two great societies have always
	lived in peace...until now. The Trade
	Federation has destroyed all that we
	have worked so hard to build. You
	are in hiding, my people are in camps.
	If we do not act quickly, all will
	be lost forever...I ask you to help
	us...no, I beg you to help us.

PADME drops to her knees and prostrates herself before BOSS
NASS. There is a gasp from Capt. Panaka, HIS TROOPS, and the
HANDMAIDENS.

		PADME
	We are your humble servants...our
	fate is in your hands.

Slowly, Capt. Panaka and his TROOPS bow down before the GUNGAN
COUNCIL.  Then the HANDMAIDENS, ANAKIN, and finally the JEDI.
The GUNGANS are puzzled by this. BOSS NASS begins to laugh.

		BOSS NASS
	Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da
	Gungans.. Mesa like dis.  Maybe wesa
	bein friends.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, and DARTH MAUL walk with a hologram of DARTH
SIDIOUS.

		NUTE
	...we've sent out patrols. We've
	already located their starship in
	the swamp... It won't be long, My
	Lord.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	This is an unexpected move for her.
	It's too aggresive... Lord Maul, be
	mindful.

		DARTH MAUL
	Yes, my Master.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	Be patient... Let them make the first
	move.

EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP/ GRASS PLAINS - DAY

A GUNGAN SENTRY sits on top of the ancient temple heah,
searching the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He
sees something and yells down to ANAKIN at the foot of the
statue.

		GUNGAN LOOKOUT
	Daza comen!

		ANAKIN
	All right. They're here!

ANAKIN yells and runs over to PADME and the JEDI, who are
discussing a battle plan with FIVE GUNGAN GENERALS. SABE and
EIRTAE stand nearby. BOSS NASS puts his arm around JAR JAR.

		BOSS NASS
	Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen da
	Naboo together.

		JAR JAR
	Oh, no, no, no...

		BOSS NASS
	So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General.

		JAR JAR
	General??! Oh, no..

JAR JAR's eyes roll back, his tongue flops out and he faints.

FOUR SPEEDERS pull up to the GROUP. Capt. Panaka and a DOZEN
OR SO GUARDS and PILOT pile out and join the group.

		PADME
	What is the situation?

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Almost everyone's in camps. A few
	hundred police and guards have formed
	an underground movement. I brought
	as many of the keaders as I could.
	The Federation Army's also much larger
	than we thought, and much stronger.
	Your Highness, this is a battle I do
	not think we can win.

		PADME
	The battle is a diversion. The Gungans
	must draw the Droid Army away from
	the cities. We can enter the city
	using the secret passages on the
	waterfall side.  Once we get to the
	main entrance, Capt. Panaka will
	create a diversion, so that we can
	enter the palace and capture the
	Viceroy.
	Without the Viceroy, they will be
	lost and confused.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.

		PADME
	What do you think, Master Jedi?

		QUI-GON
	The Viceroy will be well guarded.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	The difficulty's getting into the
	throne room. Once we're inside, we
	shouldn't have a problem.

		QUI-GON
	There is a possibility with this
	diversion many Gungans will be killed.

		BOSS NASS
	Wesa ready to do are-sa part.

JAR JAR smiles a very worried and sheepish grin. ANAKIN
watches with interest, as does ARTOO.

		PADME
	We have a plan which should immobilize
	the Droid Army. We will send what
	pilots we have to knock out the Droid
	control ship which is orbiting the
	planet. If we can get past their
	rayshields, we can sever communication
	and their droids will be helpless.

		QUI-GON
	A well-conceived plan. However,
	there's great risk. The weapons on
	your fighters may not penetrate the
	shields on the control ship.

		OBI-WAN
	And there's an even bigger danger.
	If the Vicroy escapes, Your Highness,
	he will return with another droid
	army.

		PADME
	That is why we must not fail to get
	to the Viceroy. Everything depends
	on it.

INT. THEED - PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, DARTH MAUL, OOM-9, and a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS
walk through the throne room.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	...she is more foolish than I thought.

		NUTE
	We are sending all available troops
	to meet this army of hers assembling
	near the swamp. It appears to be
	made up of primitives. We do not
	expect much resistance.

		OOM-9
	I am increasing security at all Naboo
	detention camps.

		DARTH MAUL
	I feel there is more to this, My
	Master. The two Jedi may be using
	the Queen for their own purposes.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	The Jedi cannot become involved.
	They can only protect the Queen.
	Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break
	that conenant.... This will work to
	our advantage...

		NUTE
	I have your approval to proceed then,
	My Lord.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	Proceed. Wipe them put...all of them.

INT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - DAY (FX)

All is peaceful. SMALL CRITTERS drink out of a large swamp
lake. Suddenly there is a disturbance in the middle of the
lake. A rush of bubbles, then a GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU
emerges from the water, followed by SEVERAL OTHERS. FROGS
and OTHER LITTLE ANIMALS flee in all directions as the GUNGAN
ARMY marches through the swamp. The KAADU shake themselves
off as they exit the lake. When JAR JAR's KAADU shakes off,
JAR JAR falls off.

SOLDIERS on huge, lizard-like FAMBAAS with large shield
generators mounted on their backs follow the marching
WARRIORS. The GUNGAN ARMY heads out of the swamp and onto
the rolling grassy hills.

HUNDREDS OF GUNGAN WARRIORS march in lon lines toward the
horizon.

Federation tanks move up to a ridge and stop. In the distance
they see the GUNGAN ARMY marching toward them. The GUNGAN
GENERAL CEEL sees the tanks on the ridge and orders a halt.
The GUNGANS are spread out in a large line.

JAR JAR is nervous. GENERAL CEEL signals to the shield
operators.

		GENERAL CEEL
	Energize the shields.

A red ray shoots out of the generator and blasts into a large
dish on the back of a second FAAMBA and spreads like an
umbrella over the assembled WARRIORS.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY

PADME, followed by EIRTAE, OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, ANAKIN, and
ARTOO, stealthily makes her way toward the entrance to the
main hanger. They are followed by about TWENTY NABOO GUARDS,
PILOTS, and TROOPS.  They stop, and PADME uses a small red
laser light to signal across the plaza to Capt. Panaka, RABE
and TWENTY OTHER ASSORTED NABOO TROOPS. They signal back.
QUI-GON leans over to ANAKIN.

		QUI-GON
	Once we get inside, Annie, you find
	a safe placeto hide and stay there.

		ANAKIN
	Sure.

		QUI-GON
	And stay there!

DROID TROOPS mill about the tank-filled plaza. At the far
end of the plaza, SEVERAL DROIDS begin to run and fire. NABOO
SOLDIERS begin to fire back at the BATTLE DROIDS.

As the ruckus erupts at one end of the plaza, PADME and her
TROOPS rush into the main hanger. Capt. Panaka and HIS
SOLDIERS continue to engage the DROIDS outside.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ALARMS ARE SOUNDING a PADME, the JEDI, ANAKIN, EIRTAE, and
PADME's TROOPS rush into the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS begin
firing at them as they run for cover. ANAKIN runs under a
Naboo fighter. The JEDI deflect bolts aimed at PADME back
onto the BATTLE DROIDS, causing them to EXPLODE.

INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, and FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS watch the plaza battle
on a large view screen.

		NUTE
	I thought the battle was going to
	take place far from here...this is
	too close!

		RUNE
	What is going on?

DARTH MAUL enters the throne room.

		DARTH MAUL
	I told you there was more to this...
	the Jedi are involved.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY (FX)

The Federation tanks begin to fire on the GUNGANS, but they
are protected by their energy shield.  The tanks stop firing,
and the GUNGANS CHEER, until they see the doors to the massive
transports open, and racks of BATTLE DROIDS are pulled out
and lined up by a squad of STAPS.

The BATTLE DROIDS reconfigure into their standing position.
The GUNGANS get ready for an attack. OOM-9 gives the command
to move forward, and THOUSANDS OF DROIDS march toward the
GUNGANS.

The GUNGANS power up their weapons. The DROIDS slowly march
through the protective shield and start firing.  The GUNGANS
throw their power poles and fling small balls of energy with
slingshots.  The WARRIORS dump large balls of energy into
mortars that heat up and fire the energy goo onto the BATTLE
DROIDS, causing them to short out.

The battle rages and the GUNGANS defend their shield
generators against the ARMY OF DROIDS. OOM-9 watches from a
tank on a hill overlooking the battle.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ANAKIN hides behind one of the Naboo fighters, ducking as
large bolts whiz past and EXPLODE near him. PADME and the
TWO JEDI destroy BATTLE DROIDS right and left. The QUEEN'S
TROOPS and EIRTAE also blast away at the DROIDS. PADME signals
to her pilots.

		PADME
	Get to your ships!

The PILOTS and ARTOO UNITS run for the Naboo fighter craft
stacked in the hanger bay. ONE OF THE PILOTS jumps into a
fighter right above where ANAKIN is hiding.

		FIGHTER PILOT
	Better find a new hiding place, kid.
	I'm taking this ship.

The ship begins to levitate out of the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS
fire at it as it falls in behind five other fighters. ARTOO
whistles to ANAKIN from a second fighter not far away. ANAKIN
runs and jumps into the second fighter to hide.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY (FX)

Two Naboo starfighters exit the main hanger. A tank fires at
them, hitting one of them, which causes it to pinwheel into
the ground and EXPLODE.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

Capt. Panaka, SABE and NABOO TROOPS rush into the hanger and
overwlm the few remaining BATTLE DROIDS. PADME, OBI-WAN, and
QUI-GON join forces with Capt. Panaka.

		PADME
	My guess is the Viceroy is in the
	throne room.

She looks to QUI-GON.

		QUI-GON
	I agree.

They start to head for the exit, on the way passing the
fighter where ANAKIN is hiding. ARTOO whistles a greeting as
ANAKIN peeps out of the cockpit.

		ANAKIN
	 Hey! Wait for me.

		QUI-GON
	No, Annie, you stay there. Stay right
	where you are.

		ANAKIN
	But, I...

		QUI-GON
	Stay in that cockpit.

They head for the exit. As they are about to go through the
door, suddenly everyone scatters, revealing DARTH MAUL
standing in the doorway. Capt. Panaka, PADME, and HER TROOPS
back away. QUI-GON and OBI-WAN step forward.

		QUI-GON
	We'll handle this...

The TWO JEDI take off their capes and ignite their laser
swords. DARTH MAUL takes off his cape, and ignites his laser
sword. Both ends of the sword light up.

At the far end of the hanger, SIX WHEEL DROIDS roll in and
transform into their battle position.  ARTOO calls ANAKIN's
attention to the DROIDS.  The JEDI begin to fight the Sith
Lord.

		ANAKIN
	Oh, no...

The DROIDS begin to advance and start firing on PADME and
HER TROOPS.

		ANAKIN
	We gotta do something, Artoo.

ARTOO whistles a reply. Suddenly, the ship's systems go on,
and the ship begins to levitate.

		ANAKIN
	All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea!
	I'll take over.  Let's see...

ANAKIN steers the ship toward the DROIDS. He pushes a button,
and the ship begins to shake.

		ANAKIN
	Where's the trigger? Oops, wrong
	one.. Maybe this one....

ANAKIN pushes a second button, and the lasers begin to fire,
wiping out several DESTROYER DROIDS. ARTOO whistles a cheer.

		ANAKIN
	Yeah, all right. "Droid blaster."
	Yeah!

The JEDI are engaged in a fierce sword fight with DARTH MAUL.
They have moved into the center of the hanger. While the
WHEEL DROIDS are momentarily distracted by ANAKIN, Capt.
Panaka, PADME, and HER TROOPS exit into a palace hallway.

The WHEEL DROIDS start firing at ANAKIN. There are EXPLOSIONS
all around him.

		ANAKIN
	Oops...shield up! Always on the
	right...shields always on the right.

ANAKIN flips several switches, and the after-burner ignites.

		ANAKIN
	I know we're moving. I'll shut the
	energy drive down.

The fighter rockets out of the hanger. ARTOO and ANAKIN hold
on for dear life.

		ANAKIN
	Oops!! Wrong one.

ARTOO beeps.

		ANAKIN
	I'm not doing anything!

ARTOO beeps.

		ANAKIN
	I know...I didn't push anything.

The SITH LORD's moves are incredible. He is fighting the TWO
JEDI at once, flipping into the air, outmaneuvering them at
every turn.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

The Naboo fleet leaves the planet and heads toward the space
station.

		RIC OLIE
	Bravo Flight A, take on the fighters.
	Flight B, make the run on the
	transmitter.

		BRAVO TWO
	Roger, Bravo Leader.

The fleet approaches the space station. Many Federation
fighters exit the hangers and attack.

		RIC OLIE
	Enemy fighters straight ahead!

EXT. NABOO GRASS PALINS - DAY

JAR JAR's clumsiness works for him in the battle. He gets
caught up in the wiring of a blasted DROID, dragging the
torso around with him, the DROID's gun firing randomly,
accidently blasting SEVERAL DROIDS in one process.

OOM-9 decides to send in the WHEEL DROIDS and gives the
signal.  HUNDREDS OF WHEEL DROIDS roll out of the transports
and head down toward the battle.

They slowly roll through the deflector shields, then transform
themselves once they get on the other side. The GUNGANS blast
the WHEEL DROIDS with energy balls. The DESTROYER DROIDS
blast many GUNGANS.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

A giant dogfight ensues. ANAKIN's fighter flies into space
above Naboo.

ARTOO beeps a worried concern.

		ANAKIN
	The Autopilot is searching for what
	other ships?

ARTOO beeps and whistles.

		ANAKIN
	There is no manual override, Artoo.
	You'll have to rewire it or something.

ARTOO chirps that he's trying.

		ANAKIN
	Look! There they are! That's where
	the autopilot is taking us.

ANAKIN's fighter flies toward the Federation Battleship.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

The SITH LORD drives the JEDI out of the hanger and nto the
power generator area next door.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY

Three swords are crossed in an intense display of
swordmanship. The JEDI and the SITH LORD fight their way
across the narrow bridge of the Theed power generator. DARTH
MAUL jumps onto the bridge above them. The JEDI follow, one
in front of the SITH LORD and one behind. They continue their
sword fight.

INT. THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY

PADME, Capt. Panaka, EIRTAE, SABE and THIER TROOPS are trapped
in a hallway by BATTLE DROIDS.

		PADME
	We don't have time for this, Captain.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	Let's try the outside stairway.

Capt. Panaka blasts a hole in the window, and they make their
way outside the building onto a ledge about six stories above
a raging waterfall.  SABE, EIRTAE and about TWENTY NABOO
SOLDIERS stay in the hallway to hold off the BATTLE DROIDS.

EXT. THEED - PALACE - OVER WATERFALL - DAY

PADME, Capt. Panaka, and about TEN OTHER NABOO SOLDIERS are
lined up along the edge. They have pulled small attachments
out of their pistols and fire at a ledge about four stories
above them. Thin cables shoot out of the pistols and are
embedded into the ledge. PADME, Capt. Panaka, and the OTHERS
begin to climb up the wall.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS DAY

The GUNGAN ARMY is no match for the DESTROYER DROIDS. JAR
JAR tries to run from the BATTLE DROIDS.

		GENERAL CEEL
	Retreat! Retreat!

The GUNGANS begin to turn and run, on foot, on their kaadu,
and in wagons.

JAR JAR attempts to escape on a wagon of energy balls but
only manages to unhitch the back gate, causing all of the
energy balls to roll out of the wagon and down the hill. JAR
JAR scrambles to avoid being hit by one of the balls. FOUR
DESTROYER DROIDS aren't so lucky. They get blasted by the
energy balls.

The GUNGANS renew their attack on the DROID ARMY. JAR JAR's
bumbling destroys several more DESTROYER DROIDS.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT -SPACE

ANAKIN finds himself in the middle of the space battle. A
ship explodes behind him (over his left shoulder).

		ANAKIN
	Whoo, boy! This is tense!

He looks forward to see enemy ships approaching head on.

		ANAKIN
	Oops! Artoo, get us off Autopilot!

ARTOO screams a reply.

		ANAKIN
	I've got control?

ANAKIN fips switches.

		ANAKIN
	Okay, let's go left!

He moves the controls left and the ship responds, turning
left.

		ANAKIN
	Yes...I've got control. You did it,
	Artoo!

ARTOO beeps

		ANAKIN
	Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay
	in this cockpit and that's what I'm
	gonna do. Now c'mon!

An enemy fighter comes into his sights. ANAKIN pushes the
controls and instead of firing, his fighter accelerates past
the enemy ship.

		ANAKIN
	Oops! Whoa!

Now the enemy ship is on his tail. He tries evasive
maneauvers.

		ANAKIN
	I'll try spinning, that's a good
	trick.

ANAKIN rolls the ship as ARTOO screams desperately.

		ANAKIN
	I know we're in trouble! Hang on!
	The way out of this mess is the way
	we got into it.

ARTOO beeps a reply.

		ANAKIN
	Which one? This one?

ANAKIN yanks on the reverse thrusters and the ship slows
instantly- the enemy fighter shoots past and explodes against
the space station.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

The SQUADRON attacks the space station.

		RIC OLIE
	Bravo flight...go for the central
	bridge.

		BRAVO TWO
	Roger, Bravo Leader.

The attack is fruitless.

		RIC OLIE
	Their deflector shield is too strong.
	We'll never get through it.

Meanwhile, ANAKIN is being chased by another fighter. ARTOO
shrieks.

		ANAKIN
	I know, Artoo! This isn't Podracing!

The enemy ship fires and hits ANAKIN's fighter, sending it
into a spin.

ARTOO screams.

		ANAKIN
	We're hit!

ANAKIN regains control as his ship enters the space station
hanger.

		ANAKIN
	Great gobs of bantha poo-doo!

ANAKIN's ship dodges parked transport ships and other
obstacles. A huge bulkhead blocks his way. ARTOO beeps.

		ANAKIN
	I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to
	stop! Whoa!

ANAKIN hits the reverse thrusters and the ship skids to a
stop on the hanger deck. ARTOO givesout a worried whistle.

		ANAKIN
	All right! All right! Get the system
	started!

ANAKIN ducks down to adjust a control panel.

		ANAKIN
	Everything's overheated. All the
	lights are red.

ARTOO sees DROIDS appraoching, and beeps frantically.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY

The laser sword battle continues on the small catwalk around
the vast power pit. DARTH MAUL kicks OBI-WAN off one of the
ramps and he falls several levels. QUI-GON knocks the DARK
LORD off another ramp, and he lands hard on a ramp two levels
below. QUI-GON jumps down after him. The DARK LORD backs
away along the catwalk into a small door. QUI-GON follows as
OBI-WAN runs to catch up.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECRIC BEAM - HALLWAY

The SITH LORD, followed by QUI-GON, enters a long hallway
filled with a series of deadly rays that go on and off in a
pulsing pattern that shoots down the corridor every minute
or so. DARTH MAUL makes it down several walls of deadly rays
before they close. QUI-GON is one wall away from the DARK
LORD. OBI-WAN is just starting into it and is five walls way
from DARTH MAUL.

The JEDI must wait until the next pulse to advance down the
corridor.

OBI-WAN is impatient and paces, waiting for the wall of rays
to open.

QUI-GON sits and meditates. The SITH LORD tries to patch up
his wounds.

INT. THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM

A window in the hallway blasts apart. PADME, Capt. Panaka,
and HER SOLDIERS climb into the hallway. They head for the
door to the throne roo.

Suddenly, two DESTROYER DROIDS skitter in front of the door.
PADME turns around and sees TWO MORE appear at the far end
of the hallway, trapping them in the middle.

PADME throws down her pistol and turns to Capt. Panaka.

		PADME
	Throw down your weapons. They win
	this round.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	But we can't....

		PADME
	Captain, I said throw down your
	weapons.

Capt. Panaka and HIS MEN throw down their weapons.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

A DESTROYER DROID blasts one of the shield generators, causing
it to EXPLODE. The protective shield begins to weaken and
fall apart.OOM-9 sees the shield weaken and orders his tanks
forward. The GUNGAN GENERAL signals a retreat as the tanks
enter the battle.

The GUNGANS flee as fast as they can. JAR JAR is blown off
his KAADU and lands on one of the tank guns. A GUNGAN WARRIOR
signals JAR JAR to jump off. JAR JAR is afraid. The gun swings
around trying to knock JAR JAR off.

JAR JAR hangs from the tank barrel as it moves along. Finally,
he jumps onto a KAADU behind a GUNGAN WARRIOR. EXPLOSIONS
from the tank fire are everywhere. It is chaos.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECTRIC BEAM - HALLWAY

The electric rays cycle as QUI-GON sits meditating. The wall
of the deadly rays turn away, and OBI-WAN starts running
toward QUI-GON and the DARK LORD. When the wall between QUI-
GON and DARTH MAUL opens, QUI-GON is in a split second
fighting the DARK LORD with a ferocity not seen before. They
move into the area at the end of the corridor called the
melting pit, a small area that is mostly made up of a deep
hole.

The electron ray gates begin to close. OBI-WAN tries to make
it to the melting pit but is caught one gate short. He slides
to a stop just before he hits the deadly electron field.

QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL battle around the melting pit as a
frustrated OBI-WAN watches.

DARTH MAUL cathces QUI-GON off guard. The SITH makes a quick
move, bashes his lightsaber handle into QUI-GON's chin, and
runs him through. QUI-GON slumps to the floor in a heap.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

The GUNGANS have beeb overrun. Some flee into the hills,
chased by BATTLE DROIDS on STAPS. Many OTHERS are herded
into groups by BATTLE DROIDS and DESTROYER DROIDS.

JAR JAR and GENERAL CEEL are held in a small group with OTHER
OFFICERS.

		JAR JAR
	Dissa bad, berry bombad.

		GENERAL CEEL
	Mesa hopen dissa working for da Queen.

INT. THED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

PADME, Capt. Panaka, and SIX OTHER OFFICERS are brought by
TEN BATTLE DROIDS before NUTE and RUNE and FOUR NEIMOIDIAN
COUNCIL MEMBERS.

		NUTE
	Your little insurrection is at an
	end, Your Highness. Time for you to
	sign the treaty... and end this
	pointless debate in the Senate.

SADBE dressed like the Queen appears in the doorway with
SEVERAL TROOPS.

Several destroyed battle droids can be seen in the distance.

		SABE
	I will not be signing any treaty,
	Viceroy, because you've lost!

NUTE and THE OTHERS are stunned to see a SECOND QUEEN. NUTE
yells at the TEN GUARDS in the room.

		NUTE
	After her! This one is a decoy!

SIX OF THE DROIDS rush out of the throne room after SABE.
NUTE turns to PADME.

		NUTE
	Your Queen will not get away with
	this.

PADME slumps down on her throne and immediately hits a
security button that opens a panel in her desk opposite Capt.
Panaka.  PADME grabs two pistols, tosses one of the to Capt.
Panaka and one to an OFFICER. She takes a third pistol and
BLASTS the last of the BATTLE DROIDS.

The OFFICERS rush to the door control panel as PADME hits
the switch to close the door. The OFFICER at the door jams
the controls. Capt. Panaka throws more pistols to the OTHER
GUARDS. The NEIMODIANS are confused and afraid.

		PADME
	Now, Viceroy, this is the end of
	your occupation here.

		NUTE
	Don't be absurd. There are too few
	of you. It won't be long before
	hundreds of destroyer droids break
	in to rescue us.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR - MELTING PIT

OBI-WAN screams as the pulsing electron gate opens, and the
SITH LORD attacks him. The DARK LORD is relentless in his
assault on the young JEDI.

OBI-WAN and DARTH MAUL use the Force to fling objects at
each other as they fight. DARTH MAUL seems to have the upper
hand as OBI-WAN grows weary.

DARTH MAUL catches OBI-WAN off guard, and the JEDI slips
into a melting pit. He is barely able to hold onto a nozzle
on the side of the pit. DARTH MAUL grin evilly at OBI-WAN as
he kicks OBI-WAN's lightsaber down the endless shaft.

The SITH LORD smiles as he goes in for the kill. At the last
moment, OBI-WAN jumps up out of the pit, calls QUI-GON's
lightsaber to hi, throwing DARTH MAUL off. The young JEDI
swings with a vengeance, cutting the SITH down. DARTH MAUL
falls into the melting pit to his death.

OBI-WAN rushes over to QUI-GON, who is dying.

		OBI-WAN
	Master! Master!

		QUI-GON
	It is too late...It's...

		OBI-WAN
	No!

		QUI-GON
	Obi-Wan promise... promise me you'll
	train the boy...

		OBI-WAN
	Yes, Master...

		QUI-GON
	He is the chosen one... he will...
	bring balance... train him!

QUI-GON dies. OBI-WAN cradles his Master, quietly weeping.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - FEDERATION HANGER

ANAKIN peeks over the edge of the cockpit to see BATTLE DROIDS
surrounding the ship. He ducks back down.

		ANAKIN
	Uh oh. This is not good.

He looks at the dashboard to see red lights.

		ANAKIN
	The systems are still overheated,
	Artoo.

The BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN walks up to the ship and sees ARTOO.

		BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN
	Where's your pilot?

ARTOO beeps a reply.

		BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN
	You're the pilot?

ARTOO whistles.

		BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN
	Let me see your identification!

ANAKIN sees the dashboard lights go from red to green.

		ANAKIN
	Yes...we have ignition.

He flips the switch and the engine starts.

		BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN
	     (seeing Anakin)
	You! Come out of there or we'll blast
	you!

		ANAKIN
	Not if I can help it! Shields up!

ANAKIN flips a switch and the ship levitates, knocking over
the BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN. The OTHER DROIDS shoot, but the
lasers are deflected by ANAKIN's shields. ARTOO beeeps.

		ANAKIN
	his should stop them.

ANAKIN fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate.

		ANAKIN
	...and take this!

He presses a button and launches two torpedos which miss the
DROIDS.

		ANAKIN
	Darn...I missed!

The two torpedos fly down a hallway and explode inside the
reactor room.

		ANAKIN
	Let's get out of here!

ANAKIN's ship roars through the hanger deck, bouncing over
the DROIDS.

		ANAKIN
	Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW turns to CAPTAIN DOFINE.

		TEY HOW
	Sir, we're losing power... There is

	Impossible!! I don't...

The bridge explodes.

INT. NABOO FIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

RIC OLIE watches in amazement as the Federation battleship
starts to explode from the inside out.

		BRAVO TWO
	What's that?? It's blowing up from
	the inside.

		RIC OLIE
	I don't know, we didn't hit it.

		BRAVO THREE
	Look! One of ours! Outta the main
	hold!!

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

Suddenly, all of the DROIDS begin to shake upside down, run
around in circles, then stop. The GUNGANS carefully move out
to inspect the FROZEN DROIDS. JAR JAR pushes one of the BATTLE
DROIDS, and it falls over.

		JAR JAR
	Wierdind...

		BRAVO TWO
	He flew into the hold, behind the
	deflector shield and blasted the
	main reactor...

		BRAVO THREE
	Amazing... They don't teach that in
	the academy.

ANAKIN's ship skids to a stop behind the other Naboo
starfighters. RIC OLIE, BRAVO TWO, the OTHER PILOTS, and
GROUND CREW rush to his ship.

		RIC OLIE
	We're all accounted for. Who flew
	that ship?

ANAKIN sheepishly opens the cockpit and stands up. All the
PILOTS stare in amazement.

		ANAKIN
	I'm not going to get into trouble,
	am I?

ARTOO beeps. oh. oh.

INT. MAIN HANGER - COURTYARD - DAY

The large, grand cruiser of the Supreme Chancellor lands in

	Now, Viceroy, you are going to have
	to go back to the Senate and explain
	all this.

		CAPT. PANAKA
	I think you can kiss your Trade
	franchise goodbye.

The main ramp of the cruiser is lowered as OBI-WAN and Capt.
Panaka lead the VICEROY and HIS ASSISTANT toward the ship.
The GRAND CHANCELLOR PALPATINE and SEVERAL REPUBLIC GUARDS
descend the walkway, followed by YODA and SEVERAL OTHER JEDI
MASTERS.

The CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is greeted by the QUEEN.

		AMIDALA
	Congratulations on youer election,
	Chancellor. It is so good to see you
	again.

		PALPATINE
	It's good to be home. Your boldness
	has saved our people, Your Majesty.
	It is you who should be congratulated.
	Together we shall bring peace and
	prosperity to the Republic.

OBI-WAN greets YODA and the OTHER JEDI as Capt. Panaka takes
the NEIMODIANS onto the cruiser.

INT. TURRET ROOM - NABOO PALACE - LATE DAY

The sun streams into the multi-windowed room at a low angle.
It is not quite sunset. YODA paces before OBI-WAN, who is
kneeling in the center of the room.

		YODA
	Confer on you, the level of Jedi
	Knight the Coucil does. But agree on
	you taking this boy as your Padawan
	learner, I do not.

		OBI-WAN
	Qui-Gon believed in him. I believe
	in Qui-Gon.

		YODA
	The Chosen One the boy may be;
	nevertheless, grave danger I fear in
	his training.

		OBI-WAN
	Master Yoda, Igave Qui-Gon my word.
	I will train Anakin. Without the
	approval of the Council if I must.

		YODA
	Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you.
	Need that, you do not. Agree, the
	council does. Your apprentice, young
	Skywalker will be.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - FUNERAL TEMPLE STEPS - SUNSET

QUI-GON's body goes up in flames as the JEDI COUNCIL, the
QUEEN, SIO BIBBLE, Capt. Panaka, the HANDMAIDENS, and ABOUT
ONE HUNDRED NABOO TROOPES, TWENTY OTHER JEDI, PALPATINE, OBI-
WAN (standing with ANAKIN), JAR JAR, BOSS NASS, and TWENTY
OTHER GUNGAN WARRIORS watch. There is a drum roll that stops.
Doves are released, and the body is gone. ANAKIN looks to
OBI-WAN.

		OBI-WAN
	He is one with the Force, Anakin...You
	must let go.

		ANAKIN
	 What will happen to me now?

		OBI-WAN
	I am your Master now. You will become
	a Jedi, I promise.

To one side, MACE WINDU turns to YODA.

		MACE WINDU
	There is no doubt. The mysterious
	warrior was a Sith.

		YODA
	Always two there are... no more...
	no less. A master and an apprentice.

		MACE WINDU
	But which one was destroyed, the
	master or the apprentice?

They give each other a concerned look.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY

CHILDEREN SING and throw flowers on the passing GUNGAN
SOLDIERS. The CROWDS CHEER. It is a grand parade.

QUEEN AMIDALA stands next to the SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE,
ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, SIO BIBBLE, and the JEDI COUNCIL. ARTOO
stands in front of the QUEEN'S HANDMAIDENS and whistles at
the parade. QUEEN AMIDALA and PALPATINE smile at one another
In the parade are BOSS NASS and his GUARDS, JAR JAR and
GENERAL CEEL. The GUNGANS ride KAADU.  They stop before the
QUEEN and walk up the steps to stand by her side. BOSS NASS
holds up the Globe of Peace. EVERYONE CHEERS.

The parade marches on.

EXT. SPAVE
A vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title,
following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity.

	There is unrest in the Galactic Senate
	Several hundred solar systems under
	the leadership of the rebel leader, Count
	Dooku, have decalred their intentions to
	secede from the Republic.

	This separatist movement has made it
	difficult for the limited number of
	Jedi Kights to maintain peace and
	order in the galaxy.

	Senator Amidala, the former Queen of
	Naboo, is returning to Coruscant
	to vote on the critical issue
	of creating an army to assist the
	overwhelmed Jedi.

PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo
Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal
Cruiser and two more Fighters.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN
The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun
glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they
navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
Two Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing
platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third
Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.

A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the
members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the
Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's
handmaiden.

One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes
his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer.
He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
We made it. I guess I was wrong,
there was no danger at all.

The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE
HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more
beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was
freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.

The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the
foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge
EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the
starship is destroyed.

Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS
get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO
DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage.
The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her
helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA.

		PADM
	CordE...

She gathers up her decoy double in her arms. CordE's eyes are open.
She looks up at her.

		CORD
	... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I...

CORDE dies. PADME hugs her.

		AMIDALA
	No!... No!... No!...

PADME lowers CORDE to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the
devastation. There are tears in her eyes.

		AMIDALA
	I should not have come back.

		CAPTAIN TYPHO
	M'Lady, you are still in danger.

Amidala says nothing.

		CAPTAIN TYPHO
	This vote is very important. You did
	your duty and CordE did hers. Now
	come. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady,
	please!

She turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls
off after them.

EXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY
The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small
patches of fog have still to burn off.

INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme
Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE
confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating
scooter.

		MAS AMEDDA
	Order! We shall have order! The motion
	for the Republic to commission an army
	takes precedent, and that is what we
	will vote on at this time.

Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR
PALPATINE steps to the podium.

		PALPATINE
	...My esteemed colleagues, excuse
	me... I have just received some
	tragic and disturbing news. Senator
	Amidala of the Naboo system... Has
	been assassinated!

There is a shock silence in the vast arena.

		PALPATINE
		(continued)
	This grievous blow is especially
	personal to me. Before I became
	Chancellor, I served Amidala when
	she was Queen. She was a great
	leader who fought for justice, not
	only in this honourable assembly,
	but also on her home planet. She
	was so loved she could have been
	elected queen for life. She
	believed in public service, and
	she fervently believed in
	democracy. Her death is a great
	loss to us all. We will all mourn
	her as a relentless champion of
	freedom... and as a dear friend.

There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves
his pod into the centre of the arena.

		SENATOR ASK AAK
	How many more Senators will die
	before this civil strife ends! We
	must confront these rebels now,
	and they need an army to do it.

A second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the
AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.

		AMBASSADOR DARSANA
	Why weren't the Jedi able to stop
	this assassination? We are no
	longer safe, under their protection.

Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.

		ORN FREE TAA
	The Republic needs more security
	now! Before it comes to war.

		PALPATINE
	Must I remind the Senator from
	Malastare that negotiations are
	continuing with the separatists.
	Peace is our objective here... not
	war.

The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down.
SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME,
manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.

		AMIDALA
	My noble colleagues, I concur with
	the Supreme Chancellor. At all
	costs, we do not want war!

The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and
applause.

		PALPATINE
	It is with great surprise and
	joy the chair recognises the
	Senator from Naboo, PadmE Amidala.

		PADM
	Less than an hour ago, an
	assassination attempt was made
	against my life. One of my
	bodyguards and six  others were
	ruthlessly and senselessly
	murdered. I was the target but,
	more importantly, I believe this
	security measure before you, was
	the target. I have led the
	opposition to build an army... but
	there is someone in this body who
	will stop at nothing to assure it's
	passage...

Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.

		PADM
	 	(continuing)
	I warn you, if you vote to create
	this army, war will follow. I
	have experienced the misery of war
	first-hand; I do not wish to do it
	again.

There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.

		PADM
	Wake up, Senators... you must wake
	up! If you offer the separatists
	violence, they can only show us
	violence in return! Many will
	lose their lives. All will lose
	their freedom. This decision
	could very well destroy the very
	foundation of our great Republic.
	I pray you do not let fear push
	you into a disastrous decision.
	Vote down this security measure,
	which is nothing less than a
	declaration of war! Does anyone
	here want that? I cannot believe
	they do.

There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE
TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.

		ORN FREE TAA
	My motion to defer the vote must
	be dealt with first. That is the
	rule of law.

AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic
look.

		PALPATINE
	Due to the lateness of the hour
	and the seriousness of this
	motion, we will take up these
	matters tomorrow. Until then, the
	Senate stands adjourned.

EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY
The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the
heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.

INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE sits behind his desk with TWO RED-CLAD ROYAL
GUARDS on either side of the door. YODA, PLOT KOON, KI-AD-MUNDI, and
MACE WINDU sit acress from him.

		PALPATINE
	I don't know how much longer I can
	hold off the vote, my friends.
	More and more star systems are
	joining the separatists.

		MACE WINDU
	If they do break away -

		PALPATINE
	No! I will not let that happen!

		MACE WINDU
	But if they do, you must realise
	there aren't enough Jedi to
	protect the Republic. We are
	keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

		PALPATINE
	Master Yoda, do you think it will
	really come to war?

YODA closes his eyes.

		YODA
	Worse than war, I fear... Much
	worse.

		PALPATINE
	What?

		MACE WINDU
	What do you sense, Master?

		YODA
	Impossible to see ... The Dark Side
	clouds everything. But this I am
	sure of -
		(opens his eyes)
	Do their duty the Jedi will.

A muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC, appears on the
Chancellor's desk.

		DAR WAC
	The loyalist committee has arrived,
	my Lord.

		PALPATINE
	Send them in.

They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA,
DORME, and SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER and ORN FREE TAA enter
the office. YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps
AMIDALA with his cane.

		YODA
	With you the force is strong...
	young Senator. To see you alive
	brings warm feeling to my heart.

		PADME
	Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you
	have any idea who was behind
	the attack?

		MACE WINDU
	Our intelligence points to
	disgruntled spice miners, on
	the moons of Naboo.

		PADME
	I don't wish to disagree but I
	think that Count Dooku was behind
	it.

There is a stir of surprise.

		MACE WINDU
	You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku
	was once a Jedi. He wouldn't
	assassinate anyone, it is not in
	his character.

		KI-ADI-MUNDI
	He is a political idealist, not
	a murderer.

		YODA
	In dark times nothing is what it
	appears to be, but the fact remains
	Senator, in grave danger you are.

PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast
city.

		PALPATINE
	Count Dooku has always avoided
	any kind of conflict. It appears
	he has no desire to start a war.
	Why would he kill you? To what end?

		PADME
	I don't know, but everything in my
	being tells me he was behind it...

After gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to
Mace.

		PALPATINE
	Master Jedi, may I suggest that
	the Senator be placed under the
	protection of your graces.

		BAIL ORGANA
	Do you think that is a wise use
	of manpower during these stressful
	times?

		PADME
	Chancellor, if I may comment, I
	do not believe the...

		PALPATINE
	..."situation is that serious."
	No, but I do, Senator.

		PADME
	Chancellor, please! I don't want
	any more guards!

		PALPATINE
	I realise all too well that
	additional security might be
	disruptive for you, but perhaps
	someone you are familiar with... an
	old friend like... Master Kenobi...

PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.

		MACE WINDU
	That's possible. He has just
	returned from a Border dispute on
	Ansion.

		PALPATINE
	You must remember him, M'Lady...
	he watched over you during the
	blockade conflict.

		PADME
	This is not necessary, Chancellor.

		PALPATINE
	Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I
	will rest easier. We had a big
	scare today. The thought of
	losing you is unbearable.

AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.

		MACE WINDU
	I will have Obi-Wan report to you
	immediately, M'Lady.

YODA leans into her ear.

		YODA
	Too little about yourself you
	worry, Senator, and too much about
	politics. Be mindful of your
	danger, PadmE. Accept our help.

As the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his
desk.

		PALPATINE
	I will not like this Republiv, that
	has stood for over a thousand
	years, be split in two

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - TWILIGHT
A graceful skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR - EVENING
The door to the apartment slides open. JAR JAR walks into the
corridor, where TWO JEDI are exiting the elevator. He recognises
OBI-WAN and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his
hand.

		JAR JAR
	Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen
	to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!

OBI-WAN smiles.

		OBI-WAN
	It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.

		JAR JAR
	Oops! Wheresa mesa manners?
	Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I
	completely forgot myself for
	a moment there. I have had to learn
	Diplodiaclect... speak it like a
	native now. Don't really see the
	point, actually, but members of
	the Senate seem to prefer it...

JAR JAR notices OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE.

		JAR JAR
		(continuing)
	...and this, I take it, is your
	apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie?
	Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie?
		(Looks at Anakin)
	Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen!
	Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no
	believen.

		ANAKIN
	Hi, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug.

		JAR JAR
	Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT - EVENING
PADME is in a conference with CAPTAIN TYPHO and DORME. JAR JAR enters
the room, followed by the TWO JEDI.

		JAR JAR
	Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh,
	dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten
	myself again.

PADME and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the SENATOR.
OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADME. She glances at him.

		OBI-WAN
	It's a great pleasure to see you again,
	M'Lady.

		PADME
	It has been far too long Master
	Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths
	have crossed again... but I must
	warn you that I think your
	presence here is unnecessary.

		OBI-WAN
	I'm sure the Jedi Council have
	their reasons.

She moves in front of ANAKIN

		PADME
	Annie??
		(stares)
	My goodness you've grown.

They look at each other for a long moment.

		ANAKIN
		(trying to be smooth)
	So have you... grown more
	beautiful, I mean... and much
	shorter... for a Senator, I mean.

OBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADME laughs and
shakes her head.

		PADME
	Oh Annie, you'll always be that
	little boy I knew on Tatooine.

This embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO
smile.

		OBI-WAN
	Our presence will be invisible,
	M'Lady.

		CAPTAIN TYPHO
	I am very grateful you are here,
	Master Kenobi. The situation is
	more dangerous than the Senator
	will admit.

		PADME
	I don't need more security, I need
	answers. I want to know who is
	trying to kill me.

		OBI-WAN
		(frowning)
	We're here to protect you
	Senator, not to start an
	investigation.

		ANAKIN
	We will find out who is trying to
	kill you PadmE, I promise you.

He's done it again. He bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN
gives ANAKIN a dirty look.

		OBI-WAN
	We are not going to exceed our
	mandate, my young Padawan learner.

		ANAKIN
	I meant in the interest of
	protecting her, Master, of course.

		OBI-WAN
	We are not going through this
	exercise again, Anakin. You will
	pay attention to my lead.

		ANAKIN
	Why?

		OBI-WAN
	What??!!

		ANAKIN
	Why else do you think we were
	assigned to her, if not to find
	the killer? Protection is a job
	for local security... not Jedi.
	It's overkill, Master.
	Investigation is implied in our
	mandate.

		OBI-WAN
	We will do as the Council has
	instructed, and you will learn
	your place, young one.

		PADME
	Perhaps with merely your presence,
	the mysteries surrounding this
	threat will be revealed.  Now if
	you will excuse me I will retire.

Everyone gives AMIDALA a slight bow as she and DORME leave the room.

		CAPTAIN TYPHO
	Well, I know I feel a lot better
	having you here.
	I'll have an officer on every
	floor and I'll be at the command
	centre downstairs.

		JAR JAR
	Mesa busten wit happiness seein
	Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad
	times, bombad times.

Captain Typho leaves.

		ANAKIN
	She didn't even recognise me, Jar
	Jar. I thought about her every
	day since we parted... and she's
	forgotten me completely.

		JAR JAR
	Shesa happy. Happier den mesa
	see-en her in longo time.

		OBI-WAN
	Anakin, you're focusing on the
	Negative again. Be mindful of your
	thoughts. She was glad to see us.
	Now lets check the security here.

		ANAKIN
	Yes, my master.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - EVENING
The vast Jedi Temple sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted by a
against the traffic-filled sky.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, CORRIDOR - EVENING
MACE WINDU and YODA walk down the long hallways, silhouetted by a lit
room at the end.

		MACE WINDU
	Why couldn't we see this attack on
	the Senator?

		YODA
	Masking the future, is this
	disturbance in the Force.

		MACE WINDU
	The propecy is coming true, the
	Dark Side is growing.

		YODA
	And only those who have turned to
	the Dark Side can sense the
	possibilities of the future. Only
	going through the Dark Side can we
	see.

		MACE WINDU
	It's been ten years, and the Sith
	still have no shown themselves.
	Do you think they are behind this?

		YODA
	...Out there, they are. A
	certainty that is.

		MACE WINDU
	Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice
	will be able to bring balance to
	the Force?

		YODA
	Only if he chooses to follow his
	destiny.

There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
PADME is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside
her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of
the bedroom. His power is off.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHT
ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It
is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the
apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the
room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in
his belt.

The door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters.

		OBI-WAN
	Captain Typho has more than enough
	men downstairs. No assassin will
	try that way. Any activity up
	here?

		ANAKIN
	Quiet as a tomb. I don't like
	just waiting here for something to
	happen to her.

OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his
utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of
PADME on the bed.

		OBI-WAN
	What's going on?

ANAKIN shrugs.

		ANAKIN
	She covered that camera. I don't
	think she liked me watching her.

		OBI-WAN
	What is she thinking?

		ANAKIN
	She programmed Artoo to warn us if
	there's an intruder.

		OBI-WAN
	It's not an intruder I'm worried
	about. There are many other ways
	to kill a Senator.

		ANAKIN
	I know, but we also want to catch
	this assassin. Don't we, Master?

		OBI-WAN
	You're using her as bait??

		ANAKIN
	It was her idea... No harm will
	come to her. I can sense
	everything going on in that room.
	Trust me.

		OBI-WAN
	It's too risky... and your senses
	aren't that attuned, young
	apprentice.

		ANAKIN
	And yours are?

		OBI-WAN
	Possibly.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
As PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends
out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that
shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in
the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is
removed from the window.

ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO
looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again.
The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY
LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds
and head toward the sleeping PADME.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the
apartment.

		OBI-WAN
	You look tired.

		ANAKIN
	I don't sleep well, anymore.

		OBI-WAN
	Because of your mother?

		ANAKIN
	I don't know why I keep dreaming
	About her now. I haven't seen her
	since I was little.

		OBI-WAN
	Dreams pass in time.

		ANAKIN
	I'd rather dream of PadmE. Just
	Being around her again is...
	intoxicating.

		OBI-WAN
	Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they
	betray you. You've made a
	commitment to the Jedi order... a
	commitment not easily broken...
	and don't forget she's a
	politician. They're not to be
	trusted.

		ANAKIN
	She's not like the others in the
	Senate, Master.

		OBI-WAN
	It's been my experience that
	Senators are only focused on
	pleasing those who fund their
	campaigns... and they are more
	than willing to forget the
	niceties of democracy to get those
	funds.

		ANAKIN
	Not another lecture, Master. Not
	on the economics of politics....
	It's too early in the morning... and
	besides, you're generalising. The
	Chancellor doesn't appear to
	be corrupt.

		OBI-WAN
	Palpatine's a politician, I've
	observed that he is very clever at
	following the passions and
	prejudices of the Senators.

		ANAKIN
	I think he is a good man. My
	instincts are very positive
	about...

ANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WAN

		OBI-WAN
	I sense it, too.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are
inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger
tongues flick out.


OBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their
hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front
of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.

OBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it,
crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window.

EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE
DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE
DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and
fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories
above the city.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
ANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by
the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her
shoulders.

		ANAKIN
	Stay here!

CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin
dashes out.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its
surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and
out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of
the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks.
OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back.
The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off.

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
ANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked
speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast
toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It
moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI
wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN
is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The
DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a
building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a
scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with
OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and
starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.

		OBI-WAN
	I have a bad feeling about this.

FINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls
fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages
to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the
cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the
open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.

		ANAKIN
	That was wacky! I almost lost you
	in the traffic.

		OBI-WAN
	What took you so long?

		ANAKIN
	Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't
	find a speeder I really liked,
	with an open cockpit... and with
	the right speed capabilities...
	and then you know I had to get a
	really gonzo color...

They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window
at them with her laser pistol.

		OBI-WAN
	If you'd spend as much time
	working on your saber skills as
	you do on your wit, young Padawan,
	you would rival Master Yoda as a
	swordsman.

		ANAKIN
	I thought I already did.

		OBI-WAN
	Only in your mind, my very young
	apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!

As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of
the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and
miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing
at them.

		ANAKIN
	Sorry, I forgot you don't like
	flying, Master.

		OBI-WAN
	I don't mind flying... but
	what you're doing is suicide!

They barely miss a commuter train

		ANAKIN
	Master, you know I've been flying
	since before I could walk. I'm very
	good at this.

		OBI-WAN
	Just slow down!

ZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up
of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around
right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.

		OBI-WAN
		(continuing)
	Wait! Don't go in there!

ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at
them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the
charging commuter transport.

		OBI-WAN
		(continuing)
	You know I don't like it when you
	do that!

		ANAKIN
	Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this
	guy's gonna kill himself any
	minute now!

ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw
the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the
JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI.
She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser
pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the
brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.

		OBI-WAN
	What are you doing? He's gonna
	blast me!

		ANAKIN
	Right - this isn't working.

ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic,
one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over
the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his
gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide,
flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides
with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag,
which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.

		OBI-WAN
	That was too close!

		ANAKIN
	Clear that!

		OBI-WAN
	What??

		ANAKIN
	Clear the flag! We're losing
	power! Hurry!

OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front
engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches
forward with a surge of power.

		OBI-WAN
	Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I
	don't  like it when you do that!

		ANAKIN
	So sorry, Master.

They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.

		OBI-WAN
	It's dangerous near those power
	couplings! Slow down! Don't go
	through there!

Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders
pass.

		OBI-WAN
		(continuing)
	Yiiii, what are you doing?

		ANAKIN
	Sorry, Master!

		OBI-WAN
		(sarcastically)
	Oh, that was good...

		ANAKIN
	That was crazy!!!

ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing
point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.

		ANAKIN
		(continuing)
	Ahh, damn.

		OBI-WAN
	Stop!!

		ANAKIN
	No, we can make it.

ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it,
and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and
going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the
speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant
struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a
building, stalling the speeder.

		OBI-WAN
	I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm
	crazy.

		ANAKIN
	But it worked... we made it.

		OBI-WAN
		(angrily)
	It didn't work... we've stalled!
	And you almost got us killed!

		ANAKIN
	I think we're still alive.

ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.

		OBI-WAN
		(very angrily)
	It was stupid!

		ANAKIN
		(sheepishly)
	I could have made it...

		OBI-WAN
		(furious)
	But you didn't!!! And now we've
	lost him.

Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS
surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.

		ANAKIN
	No we didnEt...

Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM.
They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard.
ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a
speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two
buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right

		OBI-WAN
	Where are you going?! He went
	down there, the other way.

		ANAKIN
	This is a shortcut... I think.

		OBI-WAN
	What do you mean, EYou think?E
	What kind of shortcut?! He went
	completely the other way! YouEve
	lost him!

		ANAKIN
	Master, if we keep this chase
	going, that creepEs gonna end up
	deep fried. Personally, IEd very
	much like to find out who in the
	hell he is and who heEs working
	for...

		OBI-WAN
		(sarcastic)
	Oh, so thatEs why weEre going in
	the wrong direction.

ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways,
then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.

		OBI-WAN
		(continuing)
	Well, you lost him.

		ANAKIN
	IEm deeply sorry, Master.

ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to
start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.

		ANAKIN
		(continuing)
	Excuse me for a moment.

ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees ZamEs
speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN
miraculously lands on top of the Bounty HunterEs speeder. The speeder
wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.

ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips
off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the
speederEs cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies
forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol.
There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the
speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM
canEt reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.

OBI-WAN has jumped into the driverEs seat of his speeder and is deftly
gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming
traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get
hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of
the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the
helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under
the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passengerEs seat.

ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls
the gun out of ZAMES hand. She grabs the JediEs hand, and they
struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of
the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles
to pull the speeder out of itEs nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by
traffic and loses sight of the Bounty HunterEs speeder.

Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls
it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks.
ANAKIN goes flying into the street.

EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT
ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off
the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.

It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights
reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various
ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of
UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.

ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM.
He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The
young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.

Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.

A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to
follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters.
PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the
street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out
ANAKIN'S lightsaber.

		OBI-WAN
	Anakin!

		ANAKIN
	She went into that club, Master.

		OBI-WAN
	Patience.

OBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.

		OBI-WAN
	 	(continuing)
	Here. Next time try not to lose it.

		ANAKIN
	Sorry, Master.

ANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.

		OBI-WAN
	A Jedi's saber is his most
	precious possession.

		ANAKIN
	Yes, Master.

He reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.

		OBI-WAN
	He must keep it with him at all
	times.

		ANAKIN
	I know, Master.

		OBI-WAN
	This weapon is your life!

		ANAKIN
	I've heard this lesson before...

OBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.

		OBI-WAN
	But, you haven't learned anything,
	Anakin.

		ANAKIN
	I try, Master.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at
them

		OBI-WAN
	Why do I think you are going to be
	the death of me?!

		ANAKIN
	Don't say that Master... You're
	the closest thing I have to a
	father... I love you. I don't want
	to cause you pain.

		OBI-WAN
	Then why don't you listen to me?!

		ANAKIN
	I will. I'll do better, I promise.

		OBI-WAN
	Do you see him him?

		ANAKIN
	I think he's a she...

		OBI-WAN
	Then be extra careful...
		(nods to a room)
	Check it out.

OBI-WAN goes away.

		ANAKIN
	Where are you going, Master?

		OBI-WAN
	To get a drink.

OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into
the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility,
suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN
arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.

CLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster
and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of
OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.

		ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
	Wanna buy some death sticks?

OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.

		OBI-WAN
	You don't want to sell me death-
	sticks.

		ELAN
	I don't want to sell you death-
	sticks.

OBI-WAN moves his fingers.

		OBI-WAN
	You want to go home and rethink
	your life.

		ELAN
	I want to go home and rethink my
	life.

He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.

CLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight.
The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.

ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The
gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.

The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim
directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber
flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The
gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.

The room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and
ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.

		ANAKIN
	Easy... Official business. Go
	back to your drinks.

Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS
pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the
ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up
hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods.

		OBI-WAN
	Do you know who it was you were
	trying to kill?

		ZAM WESSEL
	The Senator from Naboo.

		OBI-WAN
	Who hired you?

ZAM glares at OBI-WAN.

		ZAM WESSEL
	It was just a job.

		ANAKIN
	Tell us!

		ZAM WESSEL
	That Senator's gonna die soon
	anyway, and the next one won't
	make the same mistake I did...

		OBI-WAN
	This wound's going to need
	treatment.

		ANAKIN
	Who hired you? Tell us... tell us
	now!

ZAM glares hatefully.

		ZAM
	It was a Bounty Hunter called...

There is a sudden FTZZZ sound. ZAM twitches. She blinks in surprise
and dies.

There is a WEOOSH from above. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up yo see an
ARMOURED ROCKET-MAN taking off from a roof high above. OBI-WAN looks
down at ZAM. He touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking
dart.

		OBI-WAN
	Toxic Dart...

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - DAY
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand near the door of the anteroom to PADME'S
bedroom. PADME and DORME move about packing luggage.

		PADME
	Representative Binks. I know I can
	count on you.

		JAR JAR
	Yousa betchen mesa bottums.

		PADME
	What?!

		JAR JAR
		(coughs, recovers)
	Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean,
	I am honoured to accept this heavy
	burden. I take on this
	responsibility with deep humility
	tinged with an overwhelming pride.
		(pompously)
	It is not every day that I am
	called upon to...

PADME kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. JAR JAR turns red.

		PADME
	You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I
	don't wish to hold you up. I'm
	sure you have a great deal to do.

		JAR JAR
	Of course, M'lady.

JAR JAR bows and goes out. As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a dazzling
smile... PADME is in a very bad mood.

		PADME
	I do not like this idea of hiding.

		ANAKIN
	Don't worry. Now that the Council
	has ordered an investigation, it
	won't take Master Obi-Wan long to
	find that bounty hunter.

		PADME
		(frustrated)
	I haven't worked for a year to
	defeat the "Military Creation Act"
	not to be here when its fate is
	decided.

		ANAKIN
	Sometimes we have to let go of our
	pride and do what is requested of
	us.

		PADME
	Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and
	you don't have a very firm grip on
	politics. I suggest you reserve
	your opinions for some other time.

		ANAKIN
	Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying
	to...

		PADME
	Annie! No!

		ANAKIN
	Please don't call me that.

		PADME
	What?

		ANAKIN
	Annie...

		PADME
	I've always called you that... it
	is your name, isn't it?

		ANAKIN
	It's Anakin. When you say Annie
	it's like I'm still a little
	boy... and I'm not.

		PADME
	I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible
	to deny you've...
		(looks him over)
	...that you've grown up.

PADME smiles at ANAKIN. He becomes a little shy.

		ANAKIN
	Master Obi-Wan manages not to see
	it...

		PADME
	Mentors have a way of seeing more
	of our faults than we would like.
	It's the only way we grow.

		ANAKIN
	Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is
	a great mentor. As wise as Master
	Yoda and as powerful as Master
	Windu. I am truly thankful to be
	his apprentice. Only... although
	I'm a Padawan learner, in some
	ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead
	of him. I'm ready for the trials.
	I know I am! He knows it too. He
	believes I'm too unpredictable...
	Other Jedi my age have gone
	through the trials and made it...
	I know I started my training
	late... but he won't let me move
	on.

		PADME
	That must be frustrating.

		ANAKIN
	It's worse... he's overly
	critical. He never listens! He
	just doesn't understand! It's not
	fair!

PADME cannot surpress a laugh. She shakes her head.

		PADME
	I'm sorry... You sounded exactly
	like that little boy I once knew,
	when he didn't get his way.

		ANAKIN
	I'm not whining! I'm not.

PADME just smiles at him. DORME laughs in the background.

		PADME
	I didn't say it to hurt you.

		ANAKIN
	I know...

There is a brief silence. PADME comes over to ANAKIN.

		PADME
	Anakin...

They look into each other's eyes for the first time.

		PADME
		(continuing)
	Don't try to grow up too fast.

		ANAKIN
	I am grown up. You said it
	yourself.

ANAKIN looks deep into PADME'S eyes.

		PADME
	Please don't look at me like that.

		ANAKIN
	Why not?

		PADME
	Because I can see what you're
	thinking.

		ANAKIN
		(laughing)
	Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers
	too?

DORME is watching with concern.

		PADME
	It makes me feel uncomfortable.

		ANAKIN
	Sorry, M'lady.

ANAKIN backs away as PADME turns and goes back to her packing.

EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant's
Industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports
of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating
cranes lift cargo out of starships. The bus stops before a huge
intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an
overhang.

INT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and head
for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME and OBI-WAN are waiting to
hand them their luggage. DORME is dressed to look like Senator
Amidala.

		CAPTAIN TYPHO
	Be safe, m'lady.

		PADME
	Thank you, Captain. Take good
	care of Dorme... the threat's on
	you two now.

		DORME
	He'll be safe with me.

They laugh, and PADME embraces her faithful handmaiden. DORME start to
weep.

		PADME
	You'll be fine.

		DORME
	It's not me, M'Lady. I worry
	about you. What if they realise
	I'm not you?

		PADME
		(looks to Anakin)
	Then my Jedi protector will have
	to prove how grown up he is.

DORME and PADME smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him aside.

		OBI-WAN
	Anakin, you stay put on Naboo.
	Do not attract any attention. Do
	absolutely nothing without
	checking in with me or the Council.

		ANAKIN
	Yes, Master.

		OBI-WAN
		(to Padme)
	I will get to the bottom of this
	plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be
	back here in no time.

		PADME
	I will be most grateful for your
	speed, Master Jedi.

		ANAKIN
	Time to go.

		PADME
	I know.

PADME gives DORME a last hug. ANAKIN picks up the luggage, and the TWO
PEASANTS exit the speeder bus, where ARTOO is waiting for them.

		OBI-WAN
	May the Force be with you.

		ANAKIN
	May the Force be with you, Master.

They head off toward the giant Starfreighter.

		PADME
	Suddenly, I'm afraid...

		ANAKIN
	I'm kinda scared too. This is my
	first assignment on my own.

		PADME
	There's nothing to worry about...
	we have Artoo with us.

The two laugh.

OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO watch ANAKIN and PADME disappear into the
vastness of the spaceport with ARTOO trundling along behind them.

		OBI-WAN
	I hope he doesn't try anything
	foolish.

		CAPTAIN TYPHO
	I'd be more concerned about her
	doing something, than him.

EXT. FREIGHTER DOCKS - CORUSCANT - DAY
The freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of Coruscant.
It soon moves into the crowded skies.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - LATE DAY
From high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. OBI-WAN
crosses the floor of the great hallway, heaading for the Analysis
Rooms.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. He
comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A PK-4
ANALYSIS DROID comes to life. A tray slides out of the console.

		PK-4
	Place the subject for analysis on
	the sensot tray, please.

OBI-WAN puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console.
The DROID activates the system, and a screen lights up in from of
OBI-WAN.

		OBI-WAN
	It's a toxic dart. I need to know
	where it came from and who made it.

		PK-4
	One moment, please.

Diagrams and .... appear on the screem, scrolling past at great speed.
OBI-WAN watches as the screen goes blank. They tray slides out.

		PK-4
		(continuing)
	As you can see on your screen,
	subject weapon does not exist in
	any known culture. Markings
	cannot be identified. Probablt
	self-made by a warrior not
	associated with any known society.

		OBI-WAN
	Excuse me? Could you try again
	please?

		PK-4
	Master Jedi, our records are very
	thorough. they cover eight
	percent of the galaxy. If I can't
	tell you where it came from,
	nobody can.

OBI-WAN picks up the dart and looks at it, then looks to the DROID.

		OBI-WAN
	Thanks for your assistance! You
	may not be able to figure this
	out, but I think I know someone
	who might.

EXT. SPACE, STARSHIP FREIGHTER
The massive, slow-moving Freighter suddenly zooms away into
lightspeed.

INT. STARFREIGHTER, STORAGE HOLD - DAY
The great, gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their belongings.
To one side ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line, where SERVERS
are ladling out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two bowls.

		SERVER
	Keep moving! Keep moving!

ARTOO slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity.
With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something
that looks like brown bread. A SERVER sees him.

		FOOD SERVER
		(continuing)
	Hey! No Droids!

ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The
SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of
eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound
asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very
restless.

		ANAKIN
	No, no, Mom, no...

He is sweating. PADME leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his
forehead. He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. PADME
simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up
two bowls with mush.

		ANAKIN
		(continuing)
	What?

		PADME
	You seemed to be having a
	nightmare.

ANAKIN looks at PADME a little more closely, trying to see if he has
revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.

		PADME
		(continuing)
	Are you hungry?

		ANAKIN
	Thank you.

		PADME
	We went into lightspeed a while
	ago.

ANAKIN looks into PADME'S eyes.

		ANAKIN
	I look forward to seeing Naboo
	again. I've thought about it every
	day since I left. It's by far the
	most beautiful place I've ever
	seen...

PADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare.

		PADME
	You were just a little boy then.
	It may not be as you remember it;
	time changes your perception.

		ANAKIN
	I think time has given me much
	more mature feelings to enhance my
	perception.

		PADME
	It must be difficult having sworn
	your life to the Jedi... not being
	able to visit the places you
	like... or do the things you
	like...

		ANAKIN
	Or be with the people I love.

		PADME
	Are you allowed to love? I
	thought that was forbidden for a
	Jedi.

		ANAKIN
	Attachment is forbidden.
	Possession is forbidden.
	Compassion, which I would define
	as unconditional love, is central
	to a Jedi's life, so you might say
	we're encouraged to love.

		PADME
	You have changed so much

		ANAKIN
	You haven't changed a bit. You're
	exactly the way I remember you in
	my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has
	changed much either.

		PADME
	It hasn't...

		ANAKIN
	I can't wait to breathe the sweet
	breeze that comes off the rolling
	hills. Whenever I try to
	visualise the Force, those hills
	are what I see.

ANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this.

		ANAKIN
		(continuing)
	I love Naboo.

There is an awkward moment.

		PADME
		(changing the subject)
	Were you dreaming about you
	mother earlier, weren't you?

		ANAKIN
	Yes... I left Tatooine so long
	ago, my memory of her is fading.
	I don't want to lose it. Recently
	I've been seeing her in my
	dreams... vivid dreams... scary
	dreams. I worry about her.

PADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.

EXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET - MORNING
OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old
buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs
occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through.

OBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windowa it
says "DEX'S DINER" in alien lettering. He goes inside.

INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNING
A young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop.
There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by
the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating - TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS,
FREIGHTER DRIVERS etc. HERMIONE looks up as OBI-WAN comes in.

		HERMIONE
	Can I help ya?

		OBI-WAN
	I'm looking for Dexter.

HERMIONE'S eyes narrow.

		HERMIONE BAGWA
	Waddya want him for?

		OBI-WAN
	He's not in trouble. It's
	personal.

HERMIONE stares at OBI-WAN. There is a brief pause. Then she goes to
the open serving hatch behind the counter.

		HERMIONE BAGWA
	Someone to see ya, honey
		(lowering her voice)
	A Jedi, by the looks of him.

Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge
head pokes through.

		DEXTER JETTSTER
	Obi-Wan!

		OBI-WAN
	Hey, Dex.

		DEXTER JETTSTER
	Take a seat! Be right with ya!

OBI-WAN sits in a booth.

		HERMIONE BAGWA
	You want a cup of ardees?

		OBI-WAN
	Thank you.

HERMIONE moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER
JETTSTER appears. He is big - bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not
someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely.

		DEXTER JETTSTER
	Hey, ol' buddy!

		OBI-WAN
	Hey, Dex.

DEXTER eases himself into the seat opposite OBI-WAN. He can just make
it. HERMIONE sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them.

		DEXTER JETTSTER
	So, my friend. What can I do for
	ya?

		OBI-WAN
	You can tell me what this is.

OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX'S eyes widen.
He puts down his mug.

		DEXTER JETTSTER
	Well, whattaya know...

DEXTER picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and
peers at it.

		DEXTER JETTSTER
		(continuing)
	I ain't seen one of these since I
	was prospecting on Subterrel
	beyond the Outer Rim!

		OBI-WAN
	Do you know where it came from?

DEXTER grins. He puts the dart down between them.

		DEXTER JETTSTER
	This baby belongs to them cloners.
	What you got here is a Kamino
	Kyberdart.

		OBI-WAN
	Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why
	it didn't show up in any analysis
	archive.

		DEXTER JETTSTER
	It's these funny little cuts on
	the side give it away...
	Those analysis droids you've got
	over there only focus on symbols,
	you know. I should think you Jedi
	would have more respect for the
	difference between knowledge and
	wisdom.

		OBI-WAN
	Well, Dex, if droids could think, we
	wouldn't be here, would we?
		(laughing)
	Kamino... doesn't sound familiar.
	Is it part of the Republic?

		DEXTER JETTSTER
	No, it's beyond the Outer Rim.
	I'd say about twelve parsecs
	outside the Rishi Maze, toward the
	south. It should be easy to find,
	even for those droids in your
	archive to find. Those Kaminoans
	keep to themselves. They're
	cloners. Damned good ones, too.

OBI-WAN then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.

		OBI-WAN
	Cloners? Are they friendly?

		DEXTER JETTSTER
	It depends.

		OBI-WAN
	On what, Dex?

Dexter grins.

		DEXTER JETTSTER
	On how good your manners are...
	and how big your pocketbook is...

EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT - DAY
The Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.

PADME, ANAKIN and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS streaming from the
Starfreighter and into the vast docking area. They exit onto the main
plaza.

EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOON
The speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out.
The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the
rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They
pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles
behind them.

		ANAKIN
	If I grew up here, I don't think
	I'd ever leave.

		PADME
		(laughing)
	I doubt that.

		ANAKIN
	No, really. When I started my
	training, I was very homesick and
	very lonely. This city and my Mom
	were the only pleasant things I
	had to think about... The problem
	was, the more I thought about my
	Mom, the worse I felt. But I
	would feel better if I thought
	about the palace - the way it
	shimmers in the sunlight - the way
	the air always smells of flowers...

		PADME
	...and the soft sound of the
	distant waterfalls. The first
	time I saw the Capital, I was very
	young... I'd never seen a
	waterfall before. I though they
	were so beautiful... I never
	dreamed one day I'd live in the
	palace.

		ANAKIN
	Well, tell me, did you dream of
	power and politics when you were
	a little girl?

		PADME
		(laughing)
	No! That was the last thing I
	thought of. My dream was to help
	in the "Refugee Relief Movement."
	I never thought of running for
	elected office. But the more
	history I studied, the more I
	realised how much good politicians
	could do. So when I was eight, I
	joined the "Apprentice
	Legislators", then later on became
	a Senatorial advisor, with such a
	passion that, before I knew it, I
	was elected Queen. Partly because
	I scored so high on my education
	certificate, but for the most part
	it was my conviction that reform
	was possible. I wasn't the
	youngest Queen ever elected, but
	now that I think back on it, I'm
	not sure I was old enough. I'm not
	sure I was ready.

		ANAKIN
	The people you served thought you
	did a good job. I heard they
	tried to amend the Constitution so
	you could stay in office.

		PADME
	Popular rule is not democracy,
	Annie. It gives the people what
	they want, not what they need.
	And, truthfully, I was relieved
	when my two terms were up. So
	were my parents. They worried
	About me during the blockade and
	couldn't wait for it all to be
	over. Actually, I was hoping to
	have a family by now... My
	sisters have the most amazing,
	wonderful kids... but when the
	Queen asked me to serve as
	Senator, I couldn't refuse her.

		ANAKIN
	I agree! I think the Republic
	needs you... I'm glad you chose
	to serve. I feel things are going
	to happen in our generation that
	will change the galaxy in profound
	ways.

		PADME
	I think so too.

ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.

INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON
QUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a
COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at
the doors.

		QUEEN JAMILLIA
	We've been worried about you.
		(takes her hand)
	I'm so glad you're safe, PadmE.

		PADME
	Thank you, Your Highness. I only
	Wish I could have served you
	better by staying on Coruscant for
	the vote.

		SIO BIBBLE
	Given the circumstances, Senator,
	you know it was the only decision
	Her Highness could have made.

		QUEEN JAMILLIA
	How many systems have joined Count
	Dooku and the separatists?

		PADME
	About two hundred. And more are
	leaving the Republic every day.
	If the Senate votes to create an
	army, I'm sure it's going to push
	us into a civil war.

		SIO BIBBLE
	It's unthinkable! There hasn't
	been a full-scale war since the
	formation of the Republic!

		QUEEN JAMILLIA
	Do you see any way, through
	negotiations, to bring the
	separatists back into the Republic?

		PADME
	Not if they feel threatened. The
	separatists don't have an army,
	but if they are provoked, they
	will move to defend themselves.
	I'm sure of that. And with no time
	or money to build an army, my
	guess is they will turn to the
	Commerce Guilds or the Trade
	Federation for help.

		QUEEN JAMILLIA
	The armies of commerce! Why has
	Nothing been done in the Senate
	to restrain them?

		PADME
	I'm afraid that, despite the
	Chancellor's best efforts, there
	are still many bureaucrats,
	judges, and even Senators on the
	payrolls of the Guilds.

		SIO BIBBLE
	It's outrageous! After all of
	those hearings, and the four trials in
	the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is
	still the Viceroy of the Trade
	Federation. Do those money
	mongers control everything?

		QUEEN JAMILLIA
	Remember, Counsellor, the courts
	were able to reduce the
	Federation's armies. That's a
	move in the right
	direction.

		PADME
	There are rumours, Your Highness,
	that the Federation Army was not
	reduced as they were ordered.

		ANAKIN
	The Jedi have not been allowed to
	investigate. It would be to be too
	dangerous for the economy, we were
	told.

		QUEEN JAMILLIA
	We must keep our faith in the
	Republic. The day we stop
	believing democracy can work is
	the day we lose it.

		PADME
	Let's pray that day never comes.

		QUEEN JAMILLIA
	In the meantime, we must consider
	your own safety.

SIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and
leave the room.

		SIO BIBBLE
		(to Anakin)
	What is your suggestion, Master
	Jedi?

		PADME
	Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.
	He's still a Padawan learner. I
	was thinking...

		ANAKIN
		(nettled)
	Hey, hold on a minute!

		PADME
	Excuse me! I was thinking I would
	stay in the Lake Country. There
	are some places up there that are
	very isolated.

		ANAKIN
	Excuse me?! I am in charge of
	security here, M'Lady.

SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on
here.

		PADME
	Annie, my life is at risk, and
	this is my home. I know it very
	well... that is why we're here.
	I think it would be wise for you
	to take advantage of my knowledge
	in this instance.

		ANAKIN
		(takes a deep breath)
	Sorry, M'Lady.

		SIO BIBBLE
		(to Anakin, amused)
	She is right. The Lake Country is
	the most remote part of Naboo.
	Not many people and a clear view
	of the surrounding terrain.

		QUEEN JAMILLIA
	Perfect. It's settled then.

ANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all
start to leave.

		QUEEN JAMILLIA
		(continued)
	PadmE, I had an audience with your
	father yesterday. I told him what
	was happening. He hopes you will
	visit your mother before you
	leave... your family's very
	worried about you.

PADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with
activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY
A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of
Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the
striking features of the chiselled face.

On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity.
Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at
tables, studying archival material.

After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA
NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him. She is an elderly,
frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a whip.

		JOCASTA NU
	Did you call for assistance?

		OBI-WAN
		(distracted in thought)
	Yes... yes, I did...

		JOCASTA NU
	He has a powerful face, doesn't
	he? He was one of the most
	brilliant Jedi I have had the
	privilege of knowing.

		OBI-WAN
	I never understood why he quit.
	Only twenty Jedi have ever left
	the Order.

		JOCASTA NU
		(sighs)
	The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku
	was the most recent and the most
	painful. No one likes to talk
	about it. His leaving was a great
	loss to the Order.

		OBI-WAN
	What happened?

		JOCASTA NU
	Well, one might say, he was always
	a bit out of step with the
	decisions of the Council... much
	like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

		OBI-WAN
		(surprised)
	Really?

		JOCASTA NU
	Oh, yes. They were alike in many
	ways. Very individual thinkers...
	idealists...

JOCASTA NU stares at the bust

		JOCASTA NU
		(continuing
	He was always striving to become
	a more powerful Jedi. He wanted
	to be the best. With a lightsaber,
	in the old style of fencing, he
	had no match. His knowledge of
	the Force was... unique. In the
	end, I think he left because he
	lost faith in the Republic. He
	believed that politics were
	corrupt, and he felt the Jedi
	betrayed themselves by serving the
	politicians. He always had very
	high expectations of government.
	He disappeared for nine or ten
	years, then he just showed up
	recently as the head of the
	separatist movement.

		OBI-WAN
	Interesting... I'm still not sure
	I understand.

		JOCASTA NU
	Well, I'm sure you didn't call me
	over here for a history lesson.
	Are you having a problem, Master
	Kenobi?

		OBI-WAN
	Yes, I'm trying to find a planet
	system called Kamino. It doesn't
	seem to show upon any of the
	archive charts.

		JOCASTA NU
	Kamino? It's not a system I'M
	familiar with... Let me see...

JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN'S shoulder, looking at the screen.

		JOCASTA NU
		(continuing)
	Are you sure you have the right
	co-ordinates?

		OBI-WAN
		(nodding)
	According to my information, it
	should be in this quadrant
	somewhere... just south of the
	Rishi Maze.

JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.

		JOCASTA NU
	No co-ordinates? It sounds like the
	kind of directions you'd get from
	a street tout... some old miner or
	Furbog trader.

		OBI-WAN
	All three actually.

		JOCASTA NU
	Are you sure it exists?

		OBI-WAN
	Absolutely.

		JOCASTA NU
	Let me do a gravitational scan.

OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU studt the star map hologram.

		JOCASTA NU
	There are some inconsistencies
	here. Maybe the planet you're
	looking for was destroyed.

		OBI-WAN
	Wouldn't that be on record?

		JOCASTA NU
	It ought to be. Unless it was very
	recent.
		(shakes her head)
	I hate to say it, but it looks
	like the system you're searching
	for doesn't exist.

		OBI-WAN
	That's impossible... perhaps the
	archives are incomplete.

		JOCASTA NU
	The archives are comprehensive and
	totally secure, my young Jedi.
	One thing you may be absolutely
	sure of - if an item does not
	appear in our records, it does not
	exist!

OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back at the map.

EXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET - AFTERNOON
PEOPLE are passing through the little street, OLD MEN are sunning
themslves, WOMEN are gossipping, KIDS are playing. ANAKIN, PADME and
ARTOO turn onto a side street. ANAKIN is back in his Jedi robes. PADME
wear a beautiful simple dress. She stops, beaming.

		PADME
	There's my house!

PADME starts forward; ANAKIN hangs back.

		PADME
		(continuing)
	What? Don't say you're shy!

		ANAKIN
		(untruthfully)
	No, but I...

Suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO (age 6) and
POOJA (age 4). They come running toward PADME.

		RYOO & POOJA
	Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!

		PADME
	Ryoo!! Pooja!!

PADME scoops up RYOO and POOJA and hugs them.

		PADME
		(continuing)
	I'm so happy to see you! This is
	Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and
	this is Pooja.

ANAKIN and the GIRLS say hello shyly. Then:

		RYOO & POOJA
	Artoo!!!

As they see the droid, they hug him. ARTOO WHISTLES and BEEPS. PADME
laughs. ANAKIN and PADME go on toward the house. The GIRLS stay and
play with ARTOO.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
SOLA, PADME'S beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen
carrying a big bowl of food.

		SOLA
		(over her shoulder)
	They're eating over at Jev
	Narran's later, Mom. They just
	had a snack. They'll be fine.

SOLA puts the bowl down on the table, where ANAKIN, PADME and RUWEE
NABERRIE (Padme's father) are coming into the room.

		PADME
	Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.

		SOLA
	Hello, Anakin.

		ANAKIN
	Hello.

SOLA sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padme's mother) comes in with a heaped
bowl of steaming food.

		JOBAL
	You're just in time for dinner. I
	hope you're hungry, Anakin.

		ANAKIN
	A little.

		PADME
	He's being polite, Mom. We're
	starving.

		RUWEE
		(grinning)
	You came to the right place at the
	right time. Sit down, son.

EVERYONE sits and starts passing food.

		JOBAL
		(to Padme)
	Honey, it's so good to see you
	safe. We were so worried.

PADME gives JOBAL a dirty look. RUWEE smiles as he watches.

		RUWEE
	Dear...

		JOBAL
	I know, I know... but I had to say
	it. Now it's done.

		SOLA
	Well, this is exciting! Do you
	know, Anakin, you're the first
	boyfriend my sister's ever brought
	home?

		PADME
		(rolls her eyes)
	Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend!
	He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate
	to protect me.

		JOVAL
	A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They
	didn't tell us it was that serious!

		PADME
	It's not, Mom, I promise.
		(glances at Jobal)
	Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've
	known him for years. Remember
	that little boy who was with the
	Jedi during the blockade crisis?

They nod.

		PADME
		(continuing)
	He grew up.

		JOBAL
	Honey, when are you going to
	settle down? Haven't you had
	enough of that life? I certainly
	have!

		PADME
	Mom, I'm not in any danger.

		RUWEE
		(to Anakin)
	Is she?

		ANAKIN
	...Yes... I'm afraid she is.

		PADME
		(quickly)
	But not much.

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking.

		RUWEE
	Sometimes I wish I'd traveled
	more... but I must say, I'm happy
	here.

		ANAKIN
	Padme tells me you teach at the
	university?

		RUWEE
		(nodding)
	Yes, and before that, I was a
	builder. I also worked for the
	Refugee Relief Movement, when I
	was very young.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME, SOLA and JOBAL are clearing the table.

		SOLA
	Why haven't you told us about him?

		PADME
	What's there to talk about?  He's
	just a boy.

		SOLA
	A boy? Have you seen the way he
	looks at you?

		PADME
	Sola - stop it!

		SOLA
	It's obvious he has feelings for
	you. Are you saying, little baby
	sister, that you haven't noticed?

		PADME
	I'm not your baby sister, Sola.
	Anakin and I are friends... our
	relationship is strictly
	professional.
		(to Jobal)
	Mom, would you tell her to stop it?

		SOLA
		(laughing)
	Well, maybe you haven't noticed
	the way he looks at you. I think
	you're afraid to.

		PADME
	Cut it out.

		JOBAL
	Sola's just concerned... we all
	are.

		PADME
	Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What
	I'm doing is important.

		JOBAL
	You've done your service, PadmE.
	It's time you had a life of your
	own. You're missing so much!

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking in the garden. RUWEE stops and faces
ANAKIN directly.

		RUWEE
	Now tell me, son. How serious is
	this thing? How much danger is my
	daughter really in?

		ANAKIN
	There have been two attempts on
	her life. Chances are there'll be
	more. My Master is tracking down
	the assassins. I'm sure he'll find
	out who they are. This situation,
	won't last long.

		RUWEE
	I don't want anything to happen to
	her.

		ANAKIN
	I don't either.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, PADME'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME throws some things into a bag.

		PADME
	Don't worry, this won't take long.

		ANAKIN
	I just want to get there before
	dark.

PADME goes on packing. ANAKIN looks around the room.

		ANAKIN
		(continuing)
	You still live at home.

		PADME
	I move around so much, I've never
	had a place of my own. Official
	residences have no warmth. I feel
	good here. I feel at home.

		ANAKIN
	I never had a real home. Home was
	always where my Mom was.

ANAKIN picks up a framed hologram.

		ANAKIN
		(continuing)
	Is this you?

The hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or
fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are
all smiling hugely.

		PADME
	That was when I went with the
	Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.
	Their sun was imploding, and the
	planet was dying. I was helping
	to relocate the children. See
	that little one I'm holding? His
	name was N'a-kee-tula, which means
	sweethear. He was so full of
	life,. All those kids were. I did
	everything I could to save him,
	but he died... they all did. They
	were never able to adapt... to
	live off their native planet.

ANAKIN picks up another hologram. It shows PADME at age ten or eleven.
She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed
legislators. Her expression is severe.

		PADME
		(continuing)
	My first day as an Apprentice
	Legislator. Notice the difference?

PADME pulls a face. ANAKIN grins. She continues packing. ANAKIN sets
the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the
the stern, unsmiling adolescent.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - DAY
OBI-WAN walks through the main hallway to the training area.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so
FOUR-YEAR-OLDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear
helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with
their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them.

		YODA
	Don't think... feel... be as one
	with the Force. Help you, it will.
		(he sees Obi-Wan)
	Younglings - enough! A visitor we
	have. Welcome him.

The CHILDREN take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers.

		YODA
		(continuing)
	Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the
	mighty Bear Clan.

		CHILDREN
	Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!

		OBI-WAN
	I am sorry to disturb you, Master.

		YODA
	What help to you, can I be?

		OBI-WAN
	IEm looking for a planet described
	to me by an old friend. I trust
	him. But the system doesnEt show
	up on the archive maps.

		YODA
	An interesting puzzle. Gather
	round the map reader, younglings.
	Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.
	Find it, we will try...

The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The
CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and
places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room
and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the
room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the
nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display.

		OBI-WAN
	This is where it ought to be...
	but it isnEt. Gravity is pulling
	all the stars in this area inward
	to this spot. There should be a
	star here... but there isnEt.

		YODA
	Most interesting. GravityEs
	silhouette remains, but the star
	and all its planets have
	disappeared. How can this be?

There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods.

		JEDI CHILD JACK
	Because someone erased it from the
	archive memory.

		CHILDREN
	ThatEs right! Yes! ThatEs what
	happened! Someone erased it!

		JEDI CHILD MAY
	If the planet blew up, the gravity
	would go away.

OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles.

		YODA
	Truly wonderful, the mind of a
	child is. Uncluttered. To the
	centre of the pull of gravity go,
	and find your planet you will.

		OBI-WAN
	But Master Yoda who could have
	erased information from the
	archives? ThatEs impossible,
	isnEt it?

		YODA
		(frowning)
	Much harder to answer, that
	question is.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE
AFTERNOON
A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, skims
across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome
Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADME are sitting in the speeder as
it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the
middle of the lake.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and PADME walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is
parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, PADDY
ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA, as they carry the
bags into the Lodge.

ANAKIN and PADME stop at the balustrade. PADME looks out across the
garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN
looks at her silently.

		PADME
	When I was in Level Three, we used
	to come here for school retreat.
	See that island? We used to swim
	there every day. I love the water.

		ANAKIN
	I do too. I guess it comes from
	growing up on a desert planet.

PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.

		PADME
	...We used to lie on the sand and
	let the sun dry us... and try to
	guess the names of the birds
	singing.

		ANAKIN
	I donEt like sand. ItEs coarse
	and rough and irritating, and it
	gets everywhere. Not like here.
	Here everythingEs soft... and
	smooth...

He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at
her but is nervous.

		PADME
	There was a very old man who lived
	on the island. He used to make
	glass out of sand - and vases and
	necklaces out of the glass. They
	were magical.

		ANAKIN
		(looks into her eyes)
	Everything here is magical.

		PADME
	You could look into the glass and
	see the water. The way it ripples
	and moves. It looked so real...
	but it wasnEt.

		ANAKIN
	Sometimes, when you believe
	something to be real, it becomes
	real. Real enough, anyway...

They look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin.

		PADME
	I used to think if you looked too
	deeply into glass, you would
	lose yourself.

		ANAKIN
	I think it's true...

ANAKIN kisses PADME. She doesn't resist. She comes to her senses and
pulls away.

		PADME
	I shouldn't have done that.

		ANAKIN
	I'm sorry. When I'm around you,
	my mind is no longer my own.

		PADME
	It's the situation... the stress...

He looks at her.

		ANAKIN
	...the view.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
Obi-Wan's Starfighter is ready for takeoff. OBI-WAN and MACE WINDU
stand beside it.

		MACE WINDU
	Be wary, this disturbance in the
	Force is growing stronger.

		OBI-WAN
	I am concerned for my Padawan. He
	is not ready to be on his own.

		YODA
	The Council is confident in this decision,
	Obi-Wan.

		MACE
	He has exceptional skills. The
	Council is confident in its
	decision, Obi-Wan. If the
	prophecy is true, he weill be the
	one to bring balance to the Force.

		OBI-WAN
	But he still has much to learn.
	And his abilities have made him...
	well... arrogant. I realise now
	what you and Master Yoda knew from
	the beginning... the boy was too
	old to start the training and...

OBI-WAN hesitates.

		MACE WINDU
	There's something else?

		OBI-WAN
	Master, he should not have been
	given this assignment. I'm afraid
	Anakin won't be able to protect
	the Senator.

		MACE WINDU
	Why?

		OBI-WAN
	He has a... an emotional
	connection with her. It's been
	there since he was boy. Now
	he's confused... distracted.

		MACE-WINDU
	Obi-Wan, you must have faith that
	he will take the right path.

OBI-WAN climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter.

		OBI-WAN
	Has Master Yoda gained any insight
	into whether or not this war will
	come about?

		MACE WINDU
	Probing the Dark Side is a
	dangerous process. He could be in
	seclusion for days... May the
	force be with you.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA'S QUARTERS - LATE AFTERNOON
YODA sits with his eyes closed, meditating. Silence.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE, LATE AFTERNOON
The setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the
rose-tinted light. Floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the
lodge.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
NANDI place dessert in front of PADME. TECKLA does the same for
ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADME picks up her fork and
goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again -the
fruit moves. She lokk up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his plate.

		PADME
	You did that?

ANAKIN looks up - wide-eyed innocence.

		ANAKIN
	What?

PADME scowls at him. PADME jabs at the fruit - ANAKIN subtly moves his
hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her.

		PADME
	That! Now stop it!

PADME laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.

		PADME
		(continuing)
	Anakin!!

ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.

		ANAKIN
	I'm not really supposed to do
	that... for fun, I mean. If
	Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be
	very grumpy.

ANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends
one back to PADME. She bites it out of the air and laughs.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHT
A fire blazes in the open hearth. PADME is sitting in front of it,
gazing at the flames.

She looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause.

		ANAKIN
	May I tell you something?

		PADME
	I don't know.

		ANAKIN
	Then how can I tell you?

		PADME
	Maybe you should use your Jedi
	intuition.

		ANAKIN
	It doesn't work around you. My
	mind is always a muddle... I can
	only think of you.

		PADME
	Anakin, don't...

		ANAKIN
	From the moment I met you, all
	those years ago, a day hasn't gone
	by when I haven't thought of you.
	And now that I'm close to you again,
	I'm in agony. The closer I get to
	you, the worse it gets. The
	thought of not being with you
	mskes my stomach turn over - my
	mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I
	can't breathe. I'm haunted by the
	kiss you should never have given
	me. My heart is beating, hoping
	that kiss will not become a scar.
	You are in my very soul,
	tormenting me. What can I do? I
	will do anything you ask...

Silence. The logs flame in the hearth.

		ANAKIN
		(continuing)
	If you are suffering as much as I
	am, tell me.

		PADME
	...I can't. We can't. It's just
	not possible.

		ANAKIN
	Anything's possible. Padme,
	please listen...

		PADME
	You listen. We live in a real
	world. Come back to it. You're
	studying to become a Jedi Knight.
	I'm a Senator. If you follow your
	thoughts through to conclusion,
	they will take us to a place we
	cannot go... regardless of the way
	we feel about each other.

		ANAKIN
	Then you do feel something!
	There's an extraordinary
	connection between us. You can't
	deny that.

		PADME
	Annie, it doesn't make any
	difference. Jedi aren't allowed
	to marry. You swore an oath,
	remember? You'd be expelled from
	the Order. I will not let you
	give up your responsibilities...
	your future, for me.

		ANAKIN
	I was destined to be a Jedi. I
	don't think I could be anything
	else. But you are asking me to be
	rational. That is something I
	know I cannot do. I wish I could
	wish my feelings away... but I
	can't.

		PADME
	I am not going to give into this.
	I'm not going to throw my life
	away. I have more important things
	to do than fall in love.

There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.

		ANAKIN
	It wouldn't have to be that way...
	we could keep it a secret.

		PADME
	Then we'd be living a lie - one we
	couldn't keep even if we wanted
	to. Mt sister saw it. So did my
	mother. I couldn't do that.
	Could you, Anakin? Could you live
	like that?

Silence for a moment.

		ANAKIN
	...No, you're right. It would
	destroy us.

EXT. SPACE
It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet
of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship
flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's
Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on
great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves
that cover the surface of this watery world.

The Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through the
bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door
slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain.
OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE
A Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his
face.

		TAUN WE
	Welcome to Tipoca City, Master
	Jedi.

OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall,
pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond shaped eyes.

		TAUN WE
	Everything is ready. The Prime
	Minister expects you.

		OBI-WAN
		(warily)
	I'm expected?

		TAUN WE
	Of course! He is anxious to see
	you. After all these years, we
	were beginning to think you
	weren't coming. Now please, this
	way!

OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor.

Obi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY
The door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to where
LAMA SU rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the
furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light.

		TAUN WE
	May I present Lama Su, Prime
	Minister of Kamino... and this is
	Master Jedi...

		OBI-WAN
	Obi-Wan Kenobi.

		LAMA SU
	Please...

LAMA SU indicates a chair. OBI-WAN sits. TAUN WE hovers. The room is
bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech.

		LAMA SU
	I trust you are going to enjoy
	your stay. We are most happy you
	have arrived at the best part of
	the season.

		OBI-WAN
	You make me feel most welcome.

		LAMA SU
	And now to business. You will be
	delighted to hear we are on
	schedule. Two hundred thousand
	units are ready, with another
	million well on the way.

		OBI-WAN
		(improvising)
	That is... good news.

		LAMA SU
	Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas
	that we have every confidence his
	order will be met on time and in
	full. He is well, I hope?

		OBI-WAN
	I'm sorry Master - ?

		LAMA SU
	Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still
	a leading member of the Jedi
	Council, is he not?

		OBI-WAN
	Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.

		LAMA SU
		(rising)
	You must be anxious to inspect the
	units for yourself.

		OBI-WAN
	That's why I'm here.

EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW - LATER AFTERNOON
PADME and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its
lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS
graze contentedly.

Beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. Several other lakes
stretch to the horizon. The warm air is full of little floating
puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking.
PADME is picking flowers.

		PADME
	I don't know...

		ANAKIN
	Sure you do... you just don't want
	to tell me.

		PADME
	Are you going to use one of your
	Jedi mind tricks on me?

		ANAKIN
	They only work on the weak-minded.
	You are anything but weak-minded.

		PADME
	All right... his name was Palo.
	I was twelve. We were both in the
	Legislative Youth Program. He was
	a few years older then I... very
	cute... dark curly hair... dreamy
	eyes.

		ANAKIN
	All right, I get the picture...
	whatever happened to him?

		PADME
	I went on to become a Queen. He
	went on to become an artist.

		ANAKIN
	Maybe he was the smart one.

		PADME
	You really don't like politicians,
	do you?

		ANAKIN
	I like two or three, but I'm not
	really sure about one of them.
		(smiling)
	I don't think the system works.

		PADME
	How would you have it work?

		ANAKIN
	We need a system where the
	politicians sit down and discuss
	the problems, agree what's in the
	best interests of all the people,
	and then do it.

		PADME
	That is exactly what we do. The
	trouble is that people don't
	wlways agree. In fact, they
	hardly ever do.

		ANAKIN
	Then they should be made to.

		PADME
	By whom? Who's going to make them?

		ANAKIN
	I don't know. Someone.

		PADME
	You?

		ANAKIN
	Of course not me.

		PADME
	But someone.

		ANAKIN
	Someone wise.

		PADME
	That sounds an awful lot like a
	dictatorship to me.

A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.

		ANAKIN
	Well, if it works...

PADME stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, and
can't hold a smile.

		PADME
	You're making fun of me.

		ANAKIN
	 	(sarcastic)
	On no, I'd be much too frightened
	to tease a Senator.

		PADME
	You're so bad!

PADME picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it.
PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them.

		ANAKIN
	You're always so serious. Always
	carrying the weight of the
	universe on your shoulders.

ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more
fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many,
and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They
both laugh.

ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms.
PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.

The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the
SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even
harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is
face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid
face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He
catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly,
they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each
other quickly and sit up, looking away.

ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls
her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more.
PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms
around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in.
The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge
parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF
STORMTROOPERS, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in
formations of several hundred.

		LAMA SU
		(beaming)
	Magnificent, aren't they?

OBI-WAN nods slowly.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMINSSARY - DAY
LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE follows
as they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all about
twenty years old, dressed in black. They are seated at tables, eating.

		LAMA SU
	We modified their genetic
	structure to make them less
	independent than the original
	host. As a result they are
	totally obedient, taking any order
	without question.

		OBI-WAM
	Who was the original host?

		LAMA SU
	A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
	We felt a Jedi would be the
	perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-
	picked Jango Fett himself.

		OBI-WAN
	Where is this bounty hunter now?

		LAMA SU
	Oh, we keep him here. After a few
	hundred thousand clones, the
	genetic pattern starts to fade, so
	we take a fresh supply. He lives
	here, but he's free to come and go
	as he pleases.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY
The tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow,
transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube,
the CLONE goes to sleep.

		LAMA SU
	Apart from his pay, which is
	considerable, Fett demanded only
	one thing - an unaltered clone for
	himself. Curious isn't it?

		OBI-WAN
	Unaltered?

		LAMA SU
	Pure genetic replication. No
	tampering with the structure to
	make it more docile... and no
	growth acceleration...

		OBI-WAN
	I would like to meet this Jango
	Fett.

		TAUN WE
	I would be most happy to arrange
	it, for you.

TAUN WE bows, and leaves.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM - DAY
The tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY
CLONES.

		OBI-WAN
	You mentioned growth
	acceleration...

		LAMA SU
	Oh yes, it's essential.
	Otherwise, a mature clone would
	take a lifetime to grow. Now, we
	can do it in half the time. Those
	items you saw on the parade ground
	were started ten years ago, when
	Sido-dyas first placed the order,
	and they're already mature...

OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES.

		OBI-WAN
	And these?

		LAMA SU
	About five years ago.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY - DAY
They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are
filled with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended.

		LAMA SU
	They're immensely superior to
	droids, capable of independent
	thought and action.

		OBI-WAN
	Very impressive.

		LAMA SU
	I'd hoped you would be pleased.

OBI-WAN gazes at the nearest embryos.

		OBI-WAN
		(carefully)
	Tell me, prime minister, when my
	Master Sido-dyas first contacted
	you, did he say the order was
	for... himself... or?

		LAMA SU
	Himself? Of course not. This
	army is for the Republic?

		OBI-WAN
		(astonished)
	The Repubic?

		LAMA SU
	We are also very much agasint this
	Count Dooku and his seccessionist
	movement. We are proud to be of
	help to the Republic.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
TAUN WE shows OBI-WAN into his room.

		TAUN WE
	I have arranged for you to meet
	Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep
	well.

TAUN WE goes. The door slides closed behind him. OBI-WAN looks around,
then moves swiftly to check the room over. Finally, satisfied, he
takes out his comlink.

		OBI-WAN
	Arfour, Arfour...

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE
DAY
The R4 D17, Obi-Wan's Astro-Droid, who is sitting on top of Obi-Wan's
Starfighter, switches on and BEEPS.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN hears ARFOUR BEEP through his comlink.

		OBI-WAN
	Arfour, relay this, "scramble code
	five," to Courscant: care of "the
	old folks home."

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE
DAY
ARFOUR BEEPS and WHISTLES. The panels light up inside the cockpit, as
the message is transmitted.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, LIVINF QUARTERS - EARLY EVENING
YODA and MACE WINDU listen as a hologram of OBI-WAN stands between
them broadcasting the massage. The singnal is very weak, the image
fades in and out.

		OBI-WAN (V.O.)
	...I've never heard of a Jedi
	called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?

		MACE WINDU
	No. Whoever placed that order was
	not a Jedi, I can assure you.

		OBI-WAN (V.O.)
	I have a strong feeling that this
	bounty hunter is the assassin
	we're looking for.

		YODA
	Who he is working for... discover
	that, you must.

		OBI-WAN (V.O.)
	I will, Master, and I will also
	find out more about this clone
	army... May The Force...

The hologram switches off, and OBI-WAN fades away.

		WINDU
	A clone army! Ordered by someone
	in the Senate perhaps... Someone's
	out to start a war.

		YODA
	Inform the chancellor of this, we
	must.

		WINDU
	Who do you think this impostor
	Sido-Dyas, could be?

YODA stares back at MACE WINDU, then slowly shakes his head.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT - NIGHT
The silent lodge. The triple moons of Naboo reflected in the tranquil
waters of the lake.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, ANAKIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN moves restlessly in his sleep. He mutters to himself. Sweat
forms on his forehead. He turns violently. He cries out.

		ANAKIN
	No...No...No...Mom!...Don't,
	no, don't!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, BALCONY OVERLOOKING GARDENS - MORNING
ANAKIN is on the balcony overlooking the gardens. After a moment,
PAMDE comes onto the balcony behind him. She sees he is meditating and
turns to go.

		ANAKIN
		(eyes closed)
	Don't go.

		PAMDE
	I don't want to disturb you.

		ANAKIN
	Your presence is soothing.

Brief pause.

		PADME
	You had a nightmare again last
	night.

		ANAKIN
	Jedi don't have nightmares.

		PADME
	I heard you.

ANAKIN'S opens his eyes and looks at her.

		ANAKIN
	I saw my mother. I saw her as
	clearly as I see you now. She's
	suffering, Padme. She is in
	pain...They're killing her!
		(getting up)
	I know I'm disobeying my mandate
	to protect you, Senator. I know I
	will be punished and possibly
	thrown out of the Jedi Order, but
	I must go. I have to help her!
	I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a
	choice.

		PADME
	Annie, I told you I wouldn't let
	you give up your future for me.
	I'll go with you. That way you
	can continue to protect me, and
	you won't be disobeying your
	mandate.

		ANAKIN
	What about Master Obi-wan?

PADME smiles and takes his hand.

		PADME
	I guess we won't tell him, will we?

EXT. NABOO LAKE, FLOATING LANDING PLATFORM - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME step onto the landing platform from the water
speeder. They enter the Naboo Starship. ARTOO BEEPS, and follows them
on board. The ramp retracts.

PADDY ACCU drives the water speeder away from the platform as Anakin's
Starship takes off.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Rain lashes the city. Below, mightly waves pound the stilts, breaking
almost to the height of the platforms.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
TAUN WE conducts OBI-WAN to the door of Jango Fett's apartment. TAUN
WE waves his hand, and a muted bell RINGS.

As they wait, OBI-WAN notes the door lock entry mechanism. Then the
door opens, and a ten-year-old boy, BOBA FETT, looks at them. He is
identical to the boys in the classroom.

		TAUN WE
	Boba, is your father here?

There is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods.

		TAUN WE
		(continuing)
	May we see him?

		BOBA FETT
	Sure.

Another brief pause, then BOBA FETT steps aside, and TAUN WE and
OBI-WAN go through.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN, TAUN WE, and BOBA FETT enter the apartment. OBI-WAN looks
around the room.

		BOBA FETT
	Dad! Taun We's here!

JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is
unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds.
There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes
OBI-WAN with suspicion.

		TAUN WE
	Welcome back, Jango. Was your
	trip productive?

		JANGO FETT
	Fairly.

OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies both of
them.

		TAUN WE
	This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan
	Kenobi. He's come to check on our
	progress.

		JANGO FETT
	That right?

JANGO FETT'S eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly.

		OBI-WAN
	Your clones are very impressive.
	You must be very proud.

		JANGO FETT
	I'm just a simple man, trying to
	make my way in the universe,
	Master Jedi.

		OBI-WAN
	Aren't we all?

OBI-WAN eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple of
pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. JANGO FETT registers
OBI-WAN'S look. He moves in front of him, blocking the view.

		OBI-WAN
		(continuing)
	Ever made your way as far into the
	interior as Coruscant?

		JANGO
	Once or twice.

		OBI-WAN
	Recently?

		JANGO
		(eyes Obi-Wan carefully)
	Possibly...

		OBI-WAN
	Then you must know Master Sido-
	Dyas?

		JANGO
	Boba, close the door.

BOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at
OBI-WAN.

		JANGO
		(continuing)
	Master who?

		OBI-WAN
	Sido-Dyas. IsnEt he the Jedi who
	hired you for this job?

		JANGO
	Never heard of him. I was
	recuited by a man called Darth
	Tyranus on one of the moons of
	Bogden.

		OBI-WAN
	No? I thought...

		TAUN WE
	Sido-Dyas told us to expect him.
	And he showed up just when your
	Jedi Master said he would. We
	have kept the JediEs involvement
	a secret until your arrival, just
	as your Master requested.

		OBI-WAN
	Curious...

		JANGO
	Do you like your army?

		OBI-WAN
	It seems to me it's your army -
	being that they are all clones of
	you.

		JANGO
		(grinning)
	They'll do their job well, I'll
	guarantee that.

		OBI-WAN
	I look forward to seeing them in
	action. Thank you for your time,
	Jango.

		JANGO
	Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

OBI-WAN and TAUN WE go out. The door slides closed. JANGO FETT turns
to his son. He is deep in thought.

		BOBA
	What is it, Dad?

EXT. SPACE
The Naboo Starship heads toward the desert planet of Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO'S SHIP - DAY
The Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the
outskirts of Mos Espa. ANAKIN and PADME ride a rickshaw through the
streets. ANAKIN stares at sights he hasn't seen for years. Finally,
they come  to Wattos' shop, and the rickshaw stops.

		ANAKIN
		(to the droid driver)
	Wait, please.

ANAKIN and PADME get down. Sitting on a stool in front of the shop is
WATTO. He is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly DROID.
THREE PIT DROIDS are chattering away and are trying to help him, but
they seem only to make him madder.

		WATTO
		(yelling, in Huttese)
	No, not that one - that one!

		ANAKIN
		(arriving)
	Excuse me, Watto.

		WATTO
		(in Huttese)
	What?

		ANAKIN
		(in Huttese)
	I said excuse me.

WATTO turns to the chattering PIT DROIDS.

		WATTO
		(in Huttese)
	Shut down.

The PIT DROIDS snap into their storage position.

		WATTO
		(continuing, in Huttese)
	What? I don't know you... What can
	I do for you? You look like a
	Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't
	do it.

WATTO drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in Huttese

		ANAKIN
	Let me help you with that.

ANAKIN takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it.
WATTO blinks in surprise.

		ANAKIN
		(continuing)
	I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

WATTO looks at him suspiciously. He stares at PADME, then back to
ANAKIN.

		WATTO
	Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!

Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin's hands WHIRS into
life. WATTO blinks at it.

		WATTO
		(continuing; in English)
	You are Annie! It is you! You
	little womp rat.

WATTO gives ANAKIN a big hug.

		WATTO
		(continuing)
	You sure sprouted Weehoo! A
	Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe
	you couldda help wit some
	daedbeats who owe...

		ANAKIN
	My mother...

		WATTO
	Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine
	no more. I sold her.

		ANAKIN
	Sold her...

		WATTO
	Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you
	know, business is business.
	Sold her to a moisture farmer
	named Lars. Least I think it was
	Lars. Believe it or not, I heard
	he freed her and married her. Can
	ya beat that?

		ANAKIN
	Do you know where they are?

		WATTO
	Long way from here... someplace
	over on the other side of Mos
	Eisley, I think...

		ANAKIN
	I'd like to know.

ANAKIN'S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly.

		WATTO
	Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's
	go look in my records.

ANAKIN and WATTO go into the shop.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
The waves crash against the water city as the storm continues. Light
suddenlyt streams from the base of a landing platform as a door slides
open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN stands with LAMA SU and TAUN WE just inside the open door.

		LAMA SU
	Tell your Council the first
	battalions are ready. And remind
	them that if they need more
	troops, we will need time to grow
	them.

		OBI-WAN
	I won't forget.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out from the tower into the driving ran. The door closes
behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the
gale.

Below, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and
whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to
his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and
goes back to the door. It slides open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is
deserted. He moves down it.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom
door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure. All of the
Fetts' personal belongings are gone.

OBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN
ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines
securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his
armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it
inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to
swing it, when:

		BOBA FETT
	Dad!!

JANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him.
As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on.

JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN
deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.

The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He
fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.

JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher.
OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly
against the bounty hunter's armour.

IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a
laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each
other, sizing each other up - feinting.

IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT
blocks his view of OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who
deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's
shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above
OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.

OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of
the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the
shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging
around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the
Jedi's hand.

The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform.
OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the
lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking,
grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO
FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN
loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He
grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.

JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up.
JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.

OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits
JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN
charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls
over the edge.

Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging
ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his
backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the
underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto
one of the stilts.

OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just
above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in
mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it
subsides, the Jedi has disappeared.

JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down
beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the
pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.

OUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up
into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes
the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:

A HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment
later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - LATE DAY
The Naboo Starship descends, hovers, and land on a bluff. ANAKIN and
PADME get out. They look down from the edge of the bluff to where the
homestead is seen on the desert floor below.

		PADME
	Stay with the ship, Artoo.

ARTOO WHISTLES as ANAKIN and PADME start down the trail toward the
homestead.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
C-3PO is working outside the homestead. He still lacks an outer
covering; his inner parts and wiring show. He looks up as ANAKIN and
PADME arrive,

		C-3PO
	Good evening. May I help you?

		ANAKIN
	Threepio?

		C-3PO
	Oh, my... oh, my! Master
	Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly
	believe it! And this must be Miss
	Padme.

		PADME
	Hello, Threepio.

		ANAKIN
	I've come to see my mother.

		C-3PO
	Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry,
	Master Annie.

		PADME
	Threepio, what's happened?

		C-3PO
	I think we'd better go inside.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO arrive in the courtyard. THREEPIO shuffles
ahead.

		C-3PO
	Master Lars - Master Owen!
	Somebody to see you!

OWEN LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard.

		ANAKIN
	I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here
	looking for my mother.

		OWEN
	Owen Lars... I guess I'm your
	step-brother.
		(they shake hands)
	This is my girlfriend, Beru.

		BERU
	Hello.

		PADME
	I'm Padme.

		OWEN
	I had a feeling you might show up
	some day.

		ANAKIN
	Is my mother here?

		CLIEGG
	No, she's not.

CLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of
his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances
awkwardly and puts out a hand.

		CLIEGG
		(continuing)
	Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife...
	Come on inside. We have a lot to
	talk about.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN - LATE DAY
BERU puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the
kitchen...

		CLIEGG (O.S.)
	It was just before dawn. They
	came out of nowhere. A hunting
	party of Tusekn Raiders.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - LATE DAY
CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME and ANAKIN sit around the table, BERU brings the
drinks from the kitchen.

		CLIEGG
	Your mother had gone out early,
	like she always did, to pick
	mushrooms that grow on the
	vaporatos. From the tracks, she
	was about halfway when they
	took her. Those Tuskens walk like
	men, but they're vicious, mindless
	monsters. Thirty of us went out
	after her. Four of us came back.
	Three more are still out there
	looking. I'd be with them,
	only... I just couldn't ride any
	more... until I heal.

CLIEGG grimaces, easing his throbbing leg.

		CLIEGG
		(continuing)
	This isn't the way I wanted to
	meet you, son. This isn't how
	your mother and I planned it. I
	don't want to give up on her, but
	she's been gone a month. There's
	little hope she's lasted this long.

Silence. Then ANAKIN stands up.

		OWEN
	Where are you going?

		ANAKIN
	To find my mother.

		PADME
	No, Annie!

		CLIEGG
	She's daed, son. Accept it.

		ANAKIN
	I can feel her pain, and I will
	find her. I know she's alive.

ANAKIN turns abruptly.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADME comes running out of
the homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to PADME.

		ANAKIN
	You are going to have to stay
	here. These are good people,
	Padme. You'll be safe.

		OWEN
	Take my speeder bike.

		PADME
	Anakin...

PADME hugs him. ANAKIN walks over to Owen's speeder bike, which is
standing close by.

		ANAKIN
	I trust you'll watch over her,
	Owen.

		OWEN
	Don't worry.

ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires.

		ANAKIN
	I won't be long.

ANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADME watches him go.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that
form rings. Jango Fett's ship appears, heading toward it.

INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS
JANGO FETT grins at BOBA FETT.

		JANGO FETT
	Nearly there, son.

JANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly:

		BOBA FETT
	Dad, look!!

On the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO
FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets
to try to lose OBI-WAN.

		JANGO FETT
	Hang on!

The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues
between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving
and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan's
fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through.

Finally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT
breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between
two huge asteroids.

In JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very
close by.

		BOBA FETT
	Dad! Watch out!

		JANGO FETT
	Stay calm, son. We'll be fine.
	That Jedi won't be able to follow
	us through this.

But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them.

IN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws
the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid
tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN
fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid.

IN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship
appears to smash into the asteroid.

		BOBA FETT
	Got him! Yeahhhhh!

		JANGO FETT
	We won't see him again.

BOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and
heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP - SUNSET
ANAKIN stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them from
directions. The JAWAS confer exicitedly, then the CHIEF JAWA points in
a particular direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds off to
where the JAWA pointed.

EXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE - TWILIGHT
ANAKIN rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the
distance.

He rides up and stops the bike in front of a campfire. There are
bodies of THREE DEAD FARMERS lying beside the campfire. TWO EOPIES are
thethered nearby, along with a burned and smoking speeder.

EXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. ANAKIN rids the speeder bike through three
exotic landscapes. In one shot, he stops and looks down at some
tracks. Then he starts up his speeder and rides off.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
The lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close
by, a night animal HOWLS.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the
animal HOWLING nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into
the garage at the side of the courtyard.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD - GARAGE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage. Short silence.
Then:

		C-3PO
	Please don't leave us, Miss Padme.
	These people need your help.

THREEPIO is parked in a corner.

		PADME
	I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just
	can't sleep.

		C-3PO
	That's something I cannot relate
	to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm
	either active or inactive.
	There's no in-between.

		PADME
	I guess you're lucky.

		C-3PO
	Do you really think so..? I
	suppose I shouldn't expect...

		PADME
	You're not happy here?

		C-3PO
	Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my
	masters here ar so kind I
	wouldn't wish to trouuble them,
	it's just... being like this...
	well, it's embarrassing.

		PADME
	Being like what?

		C-3PO
	Naked. If you pardon the
	expression. You see, when Master
	Annie made me, he never quite
	found the time to give me any
	outer covering. It's so
	humiliating. How would you like it
	if you had to go around with all
	your circuits showing?

		PADME
	I guess I wouldn't like it at all.

		C-3PO
	Of course you wouldn't. Nobody
	would. It's simply not protocol.

PADME looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal
and tools.

		PADME
	Maybe we can do something about it.

		C-3PO
	I don't think so. Only Master
	Annie...

		PADME
	Why not? They seem to have a box
	of old coverings here.

		C-3PO
	Oh? How observant of you, Miss
	Padme. Of course, I'm just not
	mechanically minded... if you see
	what I mean.

PADME picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him.

		PADME
	Let's see, if we put this...
	here...

		C-3PO
	Ooooh! That's tickles.

		PADME
	You'll have to be quiet, Threepio.
	Hold still, please.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
A huge chunk of rock tumbles slowly through the asteroid bely. CAMERA
CLOSES, to discover Obi-Wan's Starship hidden in a blasted-out area on
the pitted back side of the great rock.

INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
OBI-WAN looks out toward Geonosis and sees in the distance a large
fleet of Trade Federation Ships hidden among the asteroids. He starts
the engines of his fighter.

Obi-Wan's Fighter moves out from the back side of the asteroid and
heads away from the asteroid field, descending toward Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
Obi-Wan's ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of
a rocky ridge. He maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands. He gets
out of the Fighter and walks onto the mesa. The wind whips at him. He
looks around.

Geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and
mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on
the arid plains.

The night is quiet, except for an occasional WEIRD CRY. OBI-WAN checks
his bearings, then heads away.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard close
by. OBI-WAN stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a
stream of peblles skittering into the darkness.

OBI-WAN listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite
it.

He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to
confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering
fangs! The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as
the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN stabs
the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up.

A SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around and cuts it
in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING. It plummets to its
death hundreds of feet below.

EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and
creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis
below. One of the huts at the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN GUARDS
outside it.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut,
flattening himself against the wall,s overhearing snatches of Tusken
conversation from inside, using the shadows to him him until he
arrives at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short
distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the black. He takes out
his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall.

INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHT
The lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He
pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere.

A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the
hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in
the middle of the hut.

He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to
the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been
terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.

		ANAKIN
	Mom... Mom... Mom...

SHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open. They are caked with blood.

		SHMI
	Annie...? Is it you?

SHMI'S eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp.

		ANAKIN
	IEm here, Mom. YouEre safe. Hang
	on. IEm going to get you out of
	here...

		SHMI
	IEm so glad... to see you,
	Annie... Now... I am complete...

		ANAKIN
	Just stay with me, Mom. IEm going
	to make you well again.
	EverythingEs going to be fine.

		SHMI
	You look so handsome. My son...
	my grown-up son. IEm so proud of
	you, Annie... so proud... I missed
	you so much... I love...

SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a
moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on
the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain
stretches into the distance. He stop, peering into the darkness, where
strange shapes loom indistinctly.

OBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts
them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic
stalagmites rise from the plain below.

SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships
come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a
hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that
are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other
platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE
DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded
Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more
Federation Starships.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN
The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold,
clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of
the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water
onto the ground.

As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a
stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a
corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN
GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is
a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as
AnakinEs lightsaber switches on.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
OBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit. He
settles into his seat. His ARFOUR DROID beeps a happy greeting.
OBI-WAN switches on his comlink.

		OBI-WAN
	"Guiding light" to "old folks
	home."

EXT. CORUSCANT, REPUBLIC EXECUTIVE BUILDING - DAY
LOW ANGLE. A line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked
by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome
building.

INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE
A hologram of OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi
(YODA, MACE WINDU, and KI-ADI-MUNDI) and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, ASK
AAK, LUMINARA, and JAR JAR). PALPATINE and MAS AMEDDA are in the
middle of the group, watching with growing concern.

		OBI-WAN
	...Starships from the Trade
	Federation and the Commerce Guilds
	are taking deliveries of battle
	droids from the foundries on
	Geonosis.

		BAIL ORGANA
	That's outrageous! The treaty
	forbids the Trade Federation from
	building up an army. What are
	they doing?!

		OBI-WAN
	The droid foundry seems to be
	working at full capacity. I am
	going to go down and investigate.
	I will bring Jango Fett back home
	for interrogation.

		PALPATINE
	Those Geonosian foundries are part
	of the Techno Union. We will call
	in their representatives and ask
	them a few very pointed questions.

		OBI-WAN
	One more thing. Jango mentioned
	he was recruited by someone named
	Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that
	might be?

		YODA
	With the forename Darth, a Sith he
	must be.

		MACE WINDU
	Our missing apprentice. They are
	playing their hand at last.

		OBI-WAN
	Do you believe he could be the
	mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the
	deal for the clone army?

		YODA
	Perhaps too many pieces are missing
	from this puzzle, there are.

		MACE WINDU
	Be careful, Obi-Wan. This
	investigation is becoming less
	than routine. Do you need help?

		OBI-WAN
	Let me see if I can figure out
	what's going on first.

The hologram of OBI-WAN fades off. PALPATINE stares at the spot where
the hologram was in disbelief.

		BAIL ORGANA
	The Commerce Guilds are preparing
	for war... there can be no doubt
	of that.

		PALPATINE
	Count Dooku must have made a
	treaty with them.

		MACE WINDU
	We must stop them soon before
	they're fully ready.

		SENATOR ASK AAK
	The debate is over, we need
	that clone army now!

		BAIL ORGANA
	Unfortunately, the debate is not
	over. The Senate will never be
	able to approve the use of that
	army before the separatists
	attack.

Mas Amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up.

		MAS AMEDDA
	This is a crisis! If the Senate
	votes the Chancellor emergency
	powers, he could approve the use
	of the army in a minute.

		PALPATINE
	Please, please, I don't wish to
	have emergency powers. That's too
	extreme a solution. It's akin to
	a dictatorship. We must rely on
	the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many
	are available to go to Geonosis?

MACE WINDU and YODA look at one another.

		YODA
	Two Hundred,... less or more.

		BAIL ORGANA
	With all due respect for the Jedi
	Order, two hundred will be no
	match for hundreds of thousands of
	battle droids.

		MACE WINDU
	Patience. We should wait for Obi-
	Wan to report back. We don't know
	that Count Dooku has made a treaty
	with the Corporate Alliance, it's
	speculation.

		SENATOR ASK AAK
	But we must prepare for the worst.
	I'm going to propose a motion
	granting emergency powers to the
	Chancellor at the next session. We
	must not wait!

		PALPATINE
	Out of the question, Senator! You
	and I are too closely aligned.
	The issue will become partisan and
	debates will begin. The proposal
	must come from a neutral source.

		MAS AMEDDA
	If only Senator Amidala were here.

JAR JAR steps forward from the back of the group.

		JAR JAR
	Supreme Chancellor... my august
	colleagues, I would be proud to
	propose the motion in question.
	This is a grave situation, and I'm
	sure Senator Amidala, and the
	Queen of Naboo would agree.

		SENATOR ASK AAK
	Thank you, Representative Binks.

Silence. Then PALPATINE sighs deeply.

		PALPATINE
	If called upon, I will serve. But
	it will be the saddest day of my
	life.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - DAY
All is quiet. BERU comes out of the house. She goes to a moisture line
and starts to draw water.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
PADME fixes the last piece of covering onto THREEPIO.

		PADME
	There!

PADME stands back. OWEN is with her. They look at THREEPIO. He isn't
the golden figure we know because PADME has had to use whatever stuff
she could findin the garage. He is multi-coloured in several textures,
but he is complete.

		C-3PO
	Um. How do I look?

		OWEN
	Great! You look perfect.

		C-3PO
	Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so
	happy!
		(extending his hand to shake hers)
	Oh, pardon me.

THREEPIO drops his hand and bows formally.

		THREEPIO
		(continuing)
	Thank you.

He forgets formality and hugs her. PADME hugs him back, laughing.

		C-3PO
		(continuing)
	Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

		OWEN
		(grinning)
	Well, Padme, I think he should be
	yours from now on... I know that
	is what my Mom would want.

		C-3PO
	Oh, my!

Then suddenly, from outside:

		BERU (V.O.)
	Come topside, everybody! He's
	back! He's back!

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
A rough hologram of OBI-WAN is projected onto the garage by ARTOO.
ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO watch the flickering image.

		OBI-WAN
	...Alliance have pledged their
	armies to Count Dooku and are
	forming an... Wait!... ah...
	attack... I don't... make it...
	aaaggghhh!

The hologram cuts off. ANAKIN jumps up, agitated.

		ANAKIN
	I'm going after him!

		PADME
	I thought the first thing he said
	was to retransmit his message to
	Coruscant.

		ANAKIN
	Yeah, you're right, you're right.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME, ARTOO and THREEPIO leave the homestead, waving to
CLIEGG, OWEN and BERU as they go into the desert.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - SUNSET
ANAKIN sits down in the cockpit with PADME. THREEPIO is behind them.
ARTOO is beside him. They are watching a hologram of MACE WINDU.

		MACE WINDU
	We will deal with Count Dooku. The
	most important thing for you,
	Anakin, is to stay where you are.
	Protect the Senator at all costs.
	That is your priority.

		ANAKIN
	Understood, Master.

The hologram switches off. PADME is looking at the readout on the
ship's control panel.

		PADME
	They'll never get there in time to
	save him. They have to come half
	way across the galaxy. Look,
	Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

PADME starts to hit buttons and flick switches. ANAKIN puts a hand
over hers, stopping her. She stares at him.

		ANAKIN
	If he's still alive.

		PADME
	Annie, are you just going to sit
	here and let him die?? He's your
	friend... your mentor...

		ANAKIN
	...He's like my father, but you
	heard Master Windu. He gave me
	strict orders to stay here.

		PADME
	He gave you strict orders to
	protect me...

PADME pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. The engines fire.

		PADME
		(continuing)
	...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan.
	So if you plan to protect me, you
	will have to come along.

ANAKIN grins and takes the controls.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - SUNSET
The Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
TWO HUNDRED JEDI KNIGHTS are assembling outside the huge center of the
Jedi Order.

INT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
The JEDI COUNCIL are assembled as MACE WINDU makes his plea.

		MACE WINDU
	The longer we wait, the stronger
	Dooku's armies become. We cannot
	wait for the Senate to make up its
	mind about granting the Chancellor
	emergency powers, in order to be
	able to use that clone army... We
	have the authority to go now. We
	must go now.

All of the JEDI COUNCIL nod their approval.

		YODA
	Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred
	Jedi send. Enough, let's hope
	they are.

INT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
Inside the great rotunda, the UPROAR is even louder. Opposing SENATOES
yell furiously at one another.

		MAS AMEDDA
	Order! Order!!

Finally, the uproar dies.

		PALPATINE
	In the regrettable absence of
	Senator Amidala, the chair
	recognises Senior
	Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar
	Binks.

Amid the conflicting storm of CHEERS AND BOOS, JAR JAR, with TWO
GUNGAN AIDES, floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space. He
looks at PALPATINE nervously. PALPATINE nods. JAR JAR clears his
throat.

		JAR JAR
	Senators, dellow felagates...

Laughter. Jeers. JAR JAR blushes.

		MAS AMEDDA
	Order! The Senate will accord the
	Representative the courtesy of a
	hearing!

Comparative quiet. JAR JAR grips the edge of the podium.

		JAR JAR
	In response to the direct threat
	to the Republic from the
	Confederacy of Independent
	Systems, I propose that the Senate
	gives immediate emergency powers to
	the Supreme Chancellor.

Uproar. JAR JAR looks a little sheepish.

		JAR JAR
		(continuing)
	Who can deny these are exceptional
	times? Exceptional times demand
	exceptional measures!
	Exceptional measures demand
	exceptional men!

		ORN FREE TAA
	We won't support a dictator.

SHOUTS of agreement.

		JAR JAR
	That is the sentiment every one of
	us agrees with! And when the
	shadow of war has dispersed and
	the bright day of liberty has
	dawned once again, the power we now
	give to the Supreme Chancellor
	will be gladly, and swiftly
	returned. Out ancient liberties
	will be restored to us, burnished
	even more brightly than before!

Brief silence, then a rolling wave of APPLAUSE. JAR JAR beams and
bows.

PALPATINE rises.

		PALPATINE
	It is with great reluctance that
	I have agreed to this calling. I
	love democracy... I love the
	Republic. The fact that this
	crisis is demanding I be given
	absolute power to tule over you is
	evident. But I am mild by nature
	and have no desire to destroy
	the democratic process. The power you
	give me I will lay down when this
	crisis has abated, I promise you.
	And all I ask in return is when my
	current term of office is over,
	you allow me to reture and live
	out my life in peace.

		MAS AMEDDA
	We shall proceed to the vote. All
	those in favor of granting
	emergency powers to the Supreme
	Chancellor, signal ate at this
	time... those opposed?

EXT. SPACE
The Naboo Starship heads toward the rings of Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA
The Naboo Starship lands.

INT. COCKPIT, NAOO STARFIGHTER - DAY
ANAKIN switches off the engines. ARTOO and THREEPIO are in the
navigation area of the cockpit. PADME is in the co-pilot's seat. She
gets up.

		ANAKIN
	Hey, where are you going?

		PADME
	To find Obi-Wan.

ANAKIN gets up and goes over to her.

		ANAKIN
	No! You're not!

He grabs her arm.

		PADME
	Let go of me!

		ANAKIN
	I'm not letting you go out there.
	It's too dangerous.

		PADME
	What?!?

		ANAKIN
	It's my job to protect you. I said
	it's too dangerous. You're not
	going, and that's final!

		PADME
	Don't you give me orders, Annie!
	I'm a Senator of the Galactic
	Republic. You have no authority
	to contain me, restrain me, or
	direct me! You remember your
	place, young man.
		(standing up)
	Now you can come along and protect
	me or stay here. It's up to you.

PADME storms out of the cockpit of the Naboo Starfighter. ANAKIN
stands scratching his head, then follows.

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

		C-3PO
	Yes, it is, Artoo. Most
	confusing. One moment they're
	generating a pleasant mutual
	attraction and the next, waves of
	violent hostility. Even though
	I'm programmed to understand them,
	I doubt if I ever shall.

ARTOO WHISTLES a plaintive sigh.

INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME enter the stalagmite city. They stop, looking around
in wonder at the emptiness.

		PADME
		(in a low voice)
	It's empty!

They start forward. As they pass, the surface of the pillars seems to
pulse slowly and move. High above WINGED CREATURES grow from the
pillars and detach themselves.

INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME cross the square, reaching the middle. They stop
suddenly as FOUR GEONOSIANS grabs them. ANAKIN reaches for his
lightsaber.

		PADME
	Wait!

TWENTY WINGED GEONOSIANS carrying weapons alight on the flagstones in
front of them.

The GEONOSIANS part, and COUNT DOOKU appears. He bows courteously.

		COUNT DOOKU
	Senator Amidala, I've heard so
	much about you.

		PADME
	Count Dooku, I assume.

		COUNT DOOKU
	I'm delighted to meet you at
	last. We have a great deal to
	discuss, Senator. I hope you can
	keep your young Jedi under control.

		PADME
	Don't worry he's housebroken.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) - DAY
COUNT DOOKU sits at a large conference table with PADME on the far
side. ANAKIN stands behind her with FOUR GEONOSIANS GUARDS standing
behind him. JANGO FETT stands behind COUNT DOOKU, and SIX GEONOSIAN
GUARDS stand behind him.

		PADME
	You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-
	Wan Kenobi. I am formally
	requesting you turn him over to
	me, now.

		DOOKU
	He has been convicted of
	espionage, Senator, and will be
	executed. In just a few hours, I
	believe.

COUNT DOOKU smiles.

		PADME
	He is an officer of the Republic.
	You can't do that.

		DOOKU
	We don't recognise the Republic
	here, Senator. But if Naboo were
	to join our Alliance, I could
	easily hear your plea for clemency.

ANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on.

		PADME
	And if I don't join your
	rebellion, I assume this Jedi with
	me will also die?

		DOOKU
	I don't wish to make you to join
	our cause against your will,
	Senator, but you are a rational,
	honest representative of your
	people and I assume you want to do
	what's in their best interest.
	Aren't you fed up with the
	corruption, the bureaucrats, the
	hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't
	you? Be honest, Senator.

		PADME
	The ideals are still alive, Count,
	even if the institution is failing.

		DOOKU
	You believe in the same ideals we
	believe in! The same ideals we
	are striving to make prominent.

		PADME
	If what you say is true, you
	should stay in the Republic and
	help Chancellor Palpatine put
	things right.

		DOOKU
	The Chancellor means well, M'Lady
	but he is incompetent. He has
	promised to cut the bureaucracy,
	but the bureaucrats are stronger
	than ever, no? Senator, the
	Republic cannot be fixed. It is
	time to start over. The
	democratic process in the Republic
	is a sham, a shell game played
	on the voters. It will not be long
	before the cult of greed, called
	the Republic, will lose even the
	pretext of democracy and freedom.

		PADME
	I cannot believe that. I will not
	forsake all I have honoured and
	worked for and betray the
	Republic. I know of your treaties
	with the Trade Federation, the
	Commerce Guilds, and the others,
	Count. What is happening here is
	not government that has been
	bought out by business... it's
	business becoming government!

		DOOKU
	Are you willing to betray your Jedi
	friends? Without your co-operation
	I can do nothing to stop their
	execution.

		PADME
	What is to happen to me? Am I to be
	executed also?

		DOOKU
	I wouldn't think of such an
	offence. But, there are
	individuals who have a strong
	interest in your demise, M'lady.
	It has nothing to do with
	politics, I'm afraid. It's purely
	personal, and they have already
	paid great sums to have you
	assassinated. I'm sure they will
	push hard to have you included in
	the executions. I'm sorry but if
	you are not going to co-operate, I
	must turn you over to the
	Geonosians for justice. I've done
	all I can for you.

JANGO FETT moves over to ANAKIN.

		JANGO FETT
	I'll take that weapon.

ANAKIN hesitates.

		DOOKU
	You may cause a lot of bloodshed,
	my young Jedi, but you will not
	escape.

		PADME
	Anakin...

ANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT.

INT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME are standing in the centre of what looks like a
courtroom. Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is POGGLE THE
LESSER, Archduke of Geonosis. He is accompanied by his underling, SUN
RIT. Off to one side the Separatist Senators PO NUDU, TESSEK, and
TOONBUCK TOORA. Next to them are the Commerce Dignitaries, SHU MAI,
NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR and SAN HILL of the
Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along the wall about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS
wait for a verdict.

		SUN RIT
	You have been charged and found
	guilty of Espionage.

		POGGLE
	Do you have anything to say before
	your sentence is carried out?

		PADME
	You are committing an act of war,
	Archduke. I hope you are prepared
	for the consequences.

POGGLE laughs. COUNT DOOKU simply smiles.

		POGGLE
	We build weapons, Senator... that
	is our business! Of course we're
	prepared!

		NUTE GUNRAY
	Get on with it. Carry out the
	sentence. I want to see her suffer.

		POGGLE
	Your other Jedi friend is waiting
	for you, Senator. Take them to
	the arena!

FOUR GUARDS take hold of PADME and ANAKIN. They are escorted out of
the chamber to the sounds of chuckling.

INT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the gloomy tunnel, ANAKIN and PADME are tossed into an open cart.
The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS extend their
arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each
other.

The DRIVER gets up onto his seat.

		ANAKIN
	Don't be afraid.

		PADME
	I'm not afraid to die. I've been
	dying a little bit each day since
	you came back into my life.

		ANAKIN
	What are you talking about?

		PADME
	I love you.

		ANAKIN
	You love me?! I thought we
	decided not to fall in love. That
	we would be forced to live a lie.
	That it would destroy our lives...

		PADME
	I think our lives are about to be
	destroyed anyway. My love for you
	is a puzzle, Annie, for which I
	have no answers. I can't control
	it... and now I don't care. I
	truly, deeply love you, and before
	we die I want you to know.

PADME leans toward ANAKIN. By straining hard, it is just possible for
their lips to meet. They kiss.

		ANAKIN
	I have no desire to be cured of
	this love either. Long or short,
	I vow to spend the rest of my life
	with you.

They kiss again.

The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the
shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there isa HUGE ROAR and
blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena

INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS.
The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of
four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. The cart stops.
PADME and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to
them. PADME is in the center.

		OBI-WAN
	I was beginning to wonder if you
	had gotten my message.

		ANAKIN
	I retransmitted it as you
	requested, Master. Then we decided
	to come and rescue you.

		OBI-WAN
	It looks like you're going a good
	job so far.

Their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives
away. There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE
GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in the archducal box and take
their places.

		SUN RIT
	The felons before you have been
	convicted of espionage against the
	Sovereign System of Geonosis.
	Their sentence of death is to be
	carried out in this public arena
	henceforth.

The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The
crowd becomes quiet.

		POGGLE
	Let the executions begin!

The crowd goes wild.

		ANAKIN
	I have a bad feeling about this.

From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in.
One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an
ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS
carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS
toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.

The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING.
Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward
them.

		OBI-WAN
	Take the one the left. I'll
	take the one on the right.

		ANAKIN
	What about Padme?

PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the
top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying
to pull the chain free.

		OBI-WAN
	It looks like she's already on top
	of things.

The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post
hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around
its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears
the chain from the post

OBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the
post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post
between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs
towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.

The NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top,
PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying
wicked, dripping fangs.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN
grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing
ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto
the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.

ANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN
hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around
his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on
the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning
to ride it.

The NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches
the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw
barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw
marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it
backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air.
She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head
with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.

In the archducal box:

		NUTE GUNRAY
	Foul!! She can't do that... shoot
	her or something!

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws
the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a
terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to
leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose.
ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.

		ANAKIN
	You okay?

		PADME
		(nods, gasping)
	Sure! Well, sort of.

		ANAKIN
	Jump!!!

The NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the
REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away,
around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the
wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack
the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.

		NUTE GUNRAY
	This isn't how it's supposed to
	be! Jango, finish her off.

COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is
enjoying the spectacle.

		COUNT DOOKU
		(smiling enigmatically)
	Patiece, Viceroy... she will die.
	Maybe this is the way it's
	supposed to end.

OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across
the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance
toward them.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
ARTOO BEEPS

		C-3PO
	Yes, it has been rather a long
	time. Do you suppose something's
	happened to them?

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

		C-3PO
		(continuing)
	Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think
	so. It looks a very dull planet
	to me. They should be back
	shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his
shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU
masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI
KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit.

		COUNT DOOKU
	Master Windu, how pleasant of you
	to join us. You're just in time
	for the moment of truth. I would
	think these two new boys of yours
	could use a little more training.

		MACE WINDU
	Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku.
	This party's over.

MACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are
sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their
lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in
slight amusement.

		COUNT DOOKU
		(to Mace Windu)
	Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi
	friend. You're impossibly
	outnumbered.

		MACE WINDU
	I don't think so. One Jedi has to
	be worth a hundred Geonosians.

COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.

		COUNT DOOKU
	It wasn't the Geonosians I was
	thinking about. How well do you
	think one Jedi will hold up
	against a thousand battle droids?

COUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts
of the arena.

MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires
at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump
into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the
Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere.
DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS.
The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the
JEDI to deflect.

The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the
riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS
and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded
pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the
arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.

Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the
sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their
lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and
GEONOSIANS.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP
ARTOO whistles.

		C-3PO
	I don't hear anything.
		(Artoo beeps)
	You're scaring me! Stop imagining
	things!

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
Among the tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed
heaps of GEONOSIANS and have kncoked out piles of DROIDS, but sheer
numbers are telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/
The rest are retreating into the arena.

ANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying
GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the
bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps,
tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty
hunter's body falls to the ground.

MACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back
with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.

		OBI-WAN
	Someone's got to - shut down -
	these droids.

		MACE WINDU
	Don't worry! It's being - taken
	care of!

EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the
lines of parked Battle Starships. They cut a swath through masses of
DROIDS until they arrive at the Command Starship. Some JEDI fall. The
rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI and teh surviving JEDI fight their way through the
corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing DROIDS.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE - DAY
THEY burst onto the bridge and chop down the COMMAND DROIDS. The
NEIMOIDIANS flee in all directions. KE-ADI-MUNDI leans over the
control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches
down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship
and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!

There is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the
bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.

		PLO KOON
	We've done it! Now we have a
	chance!

Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the
Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again!
KI-ADI-MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay.

		KI-ADI-MUNDI
	The system's off but they're still
	active. That's a new feature. They
	are independent of the control
	system.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
MACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about
TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of
BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies
of DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.

At the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father's battered
helmet. He picks it up.

KI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into
the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS
OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.

In the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower
their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.

		COUNT DOOKU
	Master Windu!

Silence.

		COUNT DOOKU
		(continuing)
	You have fought gallantly. Worthy
	of recognition in the history
	archives of the Jedi Order. Now
	it is finished.
		(pauses briefly)
	Surrender - and your lives will be
	spared.

		MACE WINDU
	We will not be hostages for you to
	barter with Dooku.

		COUNT DOOKU
	Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You
	will have to be destroyed.

The DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADME clasps hands tightly.
COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADME looks up
suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.

		PADME
	Look!

Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the
arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI.
CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a
hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by
the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.

		YODA
	Come on - hurry! Hurry!

The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU
hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of
the arena up and over the topmost rim.

EXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the DROIDS
surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of
Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS.
Beyond, more Republic Starships are landing and spewing out troops.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE - DAY
MACE WINDU stares at the incredible sight.

		YODA
	More battalions to the left.
	Encircle them we must, then
	divide.

The CLONE TROOPERS open fire with artillery. EXPLOSIONS wreck the
parked Battle Starships. CLONE TROOPERS advance, firing at the massed
DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships
and JEDI fighters.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
THREEPIO and ARTOO see flashes outside of the ship, exploding
everywhere.

		C-3PO
	I'm sure I heard something, this
	time. Didn't you? It's probably
	just a celebration

ARTOO lets out an EXHAUSTED BLEEP.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE - DAY
Gunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering
fire from the droids.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES
fire down at the DROIDS below.

The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts
it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches
violently.

		OBI-WAN
	Hold on! Look over there...

Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder
racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT
DOOKU.

		ANAKIN
	It's Dooku, go after him!

The PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship
lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.

		ANAKIN
		(continuing)
	Padme!!!

ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.

		ANAKIN
		(continuing; to pilot)
	Put the ship down! Down!

		OBI-WAN
	No! Forget her. We have to go
	after Dooku.

		ANAKIN
	No we're not!! Land this ship!

		OBI-WAN
	Don't let your personal feelings
	get in the way. We've got a job to
	do.

Below, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after
DOOKU.

		ANAKIN
	I don't care!.. Go back.

		OBI-WAN
	Anakin! She's all right! Look.

ANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS.

		OBI-WAN
		(continuing)
	Follow that speeder!

On the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after
Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian
tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows.

Count Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next
to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.

INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY
COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail
Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the
exit-port slide open.

		DROID CAPTAIN
	Your Excellency!

COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger
doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.

		COUNT DOOKU
	That won't be necessary, Captain.
	Stand down. And leave them to me.

The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU
looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.

		OBI-WAN
		(to Anakin)
	We move in together - you slowly
	on the...

		ANAKIN
	I'm taking him now!

		OBI-WAN
	Anakin, no!

		ANAKIN
	You'll pay for all the Jedi you've
	killed today, Dooku.

ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles
faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last
moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up,
hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps
to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward
OBI-WAN

		COUNT DOOKU
	Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see,
	my Jedi powers are far beyond
	yours. Now, back down.

		OBI-WAN
	I don't think so.

OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.

		COUNT DOOKU
	Ah, but if I must.

COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each
other.

		COUNT DOOKU
		(continuing)
	I have spent the last ten years
	learning to use the power of the
	Dark Side. It gives me infinitely
	greater power.

		OBI-WAN
	You will have to prove it.

OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries
the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is
the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of
the old style.

		COUNT DOOKU
	Grand Master Kenobi, you
	disappoint me. Yoda holds you in
	such high esteem.

COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.

		COUNT DOOKU
		(continuing)
	Surely you can do better...?
		(parries)
	No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi
	swordsmanship degenerated so
	quickly, or are you trying to make
	fun of me?
		(cuts)
	Which is it?

COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.

		COUNT DOOKU
		(continuing)
	come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me
	out of my misery.

OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and
comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's
superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.

COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to
the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.

OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back
against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering
across the floor.

COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly.
Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's
lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.

		COUNT DOOKU
		(continuing)
	That's brave of you, boy - but
	foolish. I would have thought
	you'd have learnt your lesson.

		ANAKIN
	I'm a slow learner.

And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the
Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU
draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and
looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.

		COUNT DOOKU
	You have unusual powers, young
	Padawan. But not enought to save
	you this time.

		ANAKIN
	Don't bet on it!

		OBI-WAN
	Anakin!

OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to
ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and
ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He
loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends
Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber.
ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to
deliver the coup de grace.

Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising
their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of
YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on
either side of him, guns pointed.

Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the
DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps
of smoking metal.

Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand
Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.

		COUNT DOOKU
	Master Yoda. At last we shall
	know who is the most powerful.

YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes
formally.

		YODA
	Count Dooku. No interest in
	contests, do I have.

COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon
the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the
contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the
great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes
become feebler, slower.

YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat.
Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed
and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.

Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He
staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA
jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber
into the top of the Count's head.

		YODA
		(continuing)
	The end for you, Count, this is.

		COUNT DOOKU
	...Not yet...

COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and
then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the
cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.
But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up,
using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.

ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the
crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the
sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.

YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE
ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane
lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship
takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's
too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADME and a
CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.

		PADME
	Anakin!

PADME runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely
able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and
salutes smartly.

		CLONE CAPTAIN
	Resistance is at an end, General.
	What are your orders ?

YODA looks at him and sighs.

EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN - DAWN
COUNT DOOKU'S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted,
burned-out part of Coruscant. COUNT DOOKU manoeuvres the ship into one
of the empty buildings and lands.

INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
The ramp lowers. COUNT DOOKU emerges and walks to where the hooded
figure of DARTH SIDIOUS stands waiting. COUNT DOOKU bows.

		COUNT DOOKU
	The Force is with us, my Master.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have
	done well.

		COUNT DOOKU
	I bring you good news, my Lord.
	The war has begun.

		DARTH SIDIOUS
	Excellent.
	 	(smiling)
	Everything is going as planned.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - SUNSET
The beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - SUNSET

		MACE WINDU
	Where is your apprentice?

		OBI-WAN
	On his way back to Naboo. He is
	escorting Senator Amidala home.

They are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great
plaza below. YODA sits in his chair.

		OBI-WAN
		(continuing)
	I must admit without the clones,
	it would not have been a victory.

		YODA
	Victory? Victory, you say?

OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council
Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is wounded, the
Chamber is empty.

		YODA
		(continuing)
	Not victory, a defeat, it was...
	Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone
	War has!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN - LATE DAY
In a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling late, ANAKIN and
PADME stand before a NABOO HOLY MAN.

THREEPIO and ARTOO stand by, watching, as the HOLY MAN blesses the
happy couple and, amid gently falling rose petals, ANAKIN and PADME
kiss.

EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING AREA, BALCONY - LATE DAY
PALPATINE, JAR JAR, BAIL ORGANA and the OTHER SENATORS, with TWO ROYAL
GUARDS, stand looking down at the square below.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS are drawn up in a strict formation
or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the Military
Assault Ships.

On the balcony, PALPATINE'S expression is deeply sad. Everyone watches
comberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off. Other land
immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with transports.
CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.

The Great Clone War has begun...

FADE OUT:

THE END

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity.

War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere.

In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate.

As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor. . . .

PAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with the Jedi Fighters as they maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R-D is on Anakin's ship. R-P is on Obi-Wan's ship. A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet.

INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently.

INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER.

ANAKIN
 There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . .

OBI-WAN
 Look out, four droids inbound . . .

EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE

The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame.

INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship.

OBI-WAN
 We've got to split them up.

ANAKIN
 Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.

OBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.

OBI-WAN
 Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?

ANAKIN
 Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.

OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.

OBI-WAN
 Anakin, they're all over me!

ANAKIN
 Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . .

ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES.

ANAKIN
 (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo!

ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning.

ANAKIN
 I copy, Artoo.

OBI-WAN
 I'm going down on the deck.

ANAKIN
 Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.

OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!

ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.

OBI-WAN
 Hurry up! I don't like this!

OBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan's Astro Droid, ARFOUR.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) Ouch!

R- BEEPS a blue streak.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.

ANAKIN
 We're locked on ... we've got him . . .

ANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.

OBI-WAN
 Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...

R- BEEPS a blue streak.

ANAKIN
 Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead.

ARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's cockpit.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids.

INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN
 I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.

Ahead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into flight configuration, lift off the CRUISER, and attack the JEDI STARFIGHTERS.

ANAKIN
 Come on, Master.

OBI-WAN
 Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?

ODD BALL
 (OS) Copy, Red Leader.

OBI-WAN
 Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .

INT. ODD BALL'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ODD BALL
 We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.

The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID TRI-FIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward the Jedi. The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the ends of their wings.

INT. ANAKIN'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ANAKIN
 This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.

ARTOO BEEPS a worried message.

OBI-WAN
 Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .

ANAKIN
 I'm going head to head. See you.

OBI-WAN
 Take it easy, Anakin.

Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.

ODD BALL
 I'm on your right, Red Leader.

ANAKIN
 Incoming!!

ARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right.

OBI-WAN
 Five more on the right!

Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS.

ANAKIN
 Here we go.

The Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.

OBI-WAN
 I'm going high and right.

ANAKIN
 Hang on. There are four more of them.

OBI-WAN
 Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.

ANAKIN
 I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.

OBI-WAN
 All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.

In one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.

ARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him.

ANAKIN
 How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good.

OBI-WAN
 Anakin, you have four on your tail.

ANAKIN
 I know. I know!

OBI-WAN
 Four more closing from your left.

ANAKIN
 I know. I know!

OBI-WAN
 Break right and go high.

ANAKIN
 I'm going low and left.

Obi-Wan shakes his head.

OBI-WAN
 (to himself) He still has much to learn.

ANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.

ANAKIN
 Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .

OBI-WAN
 Too dangerous. First Jedi rule
 "Survive."

ANAKIN
 Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.

OBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN
 Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.

OBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.

ARTOO BEEPS nervously.

ANAKIN
 Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.

OBI-WAN
 Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.

ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."

ANAKIN
 Wrong thought, Artoo.

ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) I'm through.

OBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION.
A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space.
Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS.

ODD BALL
 There are too many of them.

CLONE PILOT 
 I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .

ANAKIN
 I'm going to go help them out!

OBI-WAN
 No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!

Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them.

ANAKIN
 Missiles! Pull up!

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot.

OBI-WAN
 They overshot us . . .

The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan’s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them.

ANAKIN
 They're coming around!

OBI-WAN
 All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.

ANAKIN
 Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.

ANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.

ANAKIN
 We got 'em. Artoo!

Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.

OBI-WAN
 Flying is for droids.

Suddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin?

ANAKIN
 I see them . . . Buzz Droids.

The BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR.

OBI-WAN
 Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .

ARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away.

OBI-WAN
 Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.

ANAKIN
 Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.

OBI-WAN
 The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here.

ANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wan’s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) In the name of ...

ANAKIN
 Steady . . . steady . . .

OBI-WAN
 Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.

ANAKIN
 I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .

OBI-WAN
 Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.

ANAKIN
 Move to the right.

OBI-WAN
 Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.

ANAKIN
 I'm not leaving without you, Master.

ANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN's and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN's ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi's view.

ANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin's ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID.

OBI-WAN
 Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.

ANAKIN
 Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!

OBI-WAN
 Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship.

ANAKIN
 Yeah, you got him!

OBI-WAN
 Great, Artoo.

ANAKIN
 Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.

OBI-WAN
 Have you noticed the shields are still up?

ANAKIN
 Oh?!? Sorry, Master.

ANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN's disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES.

OBI-WAN
 Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.

INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The shield door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A set of blast doors starts SLAMMING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space.

ANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut.
OBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at him from all directions.

ANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANAKIN.

OBI-WAN
 Artoo, locate the Chancellor.

ANAKIN
 Tap into the ship's computers.

They cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation ship appears.

OBI-WAN
 The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.

ANAKIN
 I sense Count Dooku . . .

OBI-WAN
 I sense a trap.

ANAKIN
 Next move?

OBI-WAN
 Spring the trap.

The JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to ARTOO.

ANAKIN
 Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.

OBI-WAN
 Here, take this, and wait for orders.

OBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO.

INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the bridge of the TRADE FEDERATION cruiser followed by his TWO BODYGUARDS. He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 What's the situation, Captain?

CAPTAIN
 TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Just as Count Dooku predicted.

INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI.

BODYGUARD I
 General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.

OBI-WAN
 We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.

As a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back.

OBI-WAN
 Anakin. . .

ANAKIN
 Ready.

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor.

INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.

OBI-WAN
 . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.

ANAKIN
 Well then, we're safe for the time being.

OBI-WAN
 Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.

They run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers.

ANAKIN
 They're sealing this section off.

OBI-WAN
 Six droids coming our way!

The last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance.

ANAKIN
 Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.

They move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers.

OBI-WAN
 We'll never get through that. It's too small!

They move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-WAN disables the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.

The fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.

ANAKIN
 I found our escape vent.

OBI-WAN
 Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.

ANAKIN
 Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .

ANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a "man-sized" work shaft. They scramble through it as the DROIDS swim closer.

INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube.

ANAKIN
 Here's a way out.

As the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the JEDI work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch.

INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end.

 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

A hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation Cruiser, and the JEDI squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his laser sword.

OBI-WAN
 That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.

ANAKIN
 The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.

OBI-WAN
 You still have much to learn, Anakin.

 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger.

SUPER BATTLE DROID R
 I have a bad feeling about this.

 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The fuel hits the SPARKING power discharger, and there is a HUGE EXPLOSION.

 EXT. TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-BATTLE

A GREAT EXPLOSION and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the Federation Cruiser.

 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

A large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the EXPLOSION hits. OBI-WAN jumps back, then stands amazed.

OBI-WAN
 All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let's go!

ANAKIN grins at OBI-WAN, and they run down the hallway.

 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The two JEDI wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to face with THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. The DROIDS start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts. OBI-WAN frantically pushes the elevator button several more times.

ANAKIN
 Destroyers!!

Finally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The JEDI turn to see BATTLE DROIDS standing behind them.

BATTLE DROID
 Drop your weapons! I said drop 'em.

The JEDI activate their light sabers and destroy all the BATTLE DROIDS.

 INT HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

R-D notices two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS entering the hangar. He moves and hides behind a Jedi Starfighter.

 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop.

OBI-WAN
 Did you press the stop button?

ANAKIN
 No, did you?

OBI-WAN
 No!

ANAKIN
 Well, there's more than one way out of here.

ANAKIN ignites his laser sword.

OBI-WAN
 We don't want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel) . . .  . . .

ANAKIN cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling.

 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS are inspecting the Jedi starfighters. They overhear Obi-Wan's voice over the comlink and are distracted.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 
 What's that?

SUPER BATTLE DROID 
 Get back to work. It's nothing.

 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN
 Artoo?

ANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) Always on the move.

OBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a reply.

 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS try to figure out where the voices are coming from. ARTOO extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface.

OBI-WAN
 (OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo.

 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Suddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. ANAKIN quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. He watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. ANAKIN struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as SPARKING wires rain down on him.

 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator starts to descend rapidly.

OBI-WAN
 Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up.

 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Anakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft. The door to the elevator shaft is pried open, and TWO BATTLE DROIDS appear in the doorway and look down at ANAKIN. They point their guns at him.

DROID 
 Hands up, Jedi! Don't move.

DROID 
 Roger, roger.

 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS overhear OBI-WAN's comlink messages to ARTOO.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 
 There it is again.

OBI-WAN
 (OS) Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.

 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator races down as OBI-WAN holds on.

OBI-WAN
 Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!

The elevator stops with a jolt. OBI-WAN falls to the floor.

 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS see ARTOO and walk toward the little droid.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 
 Hey you!

ARTOO plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots up.

 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN stands up after having fallen in the elevator.

OBI-WAN
 Now, that's better . . .

 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO is held up by TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS, who chuckle as the little Astro Droid curses and swings at them.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 
 You stupid little astro droid!

 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed. He looks at the BATTLE DROIDS leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. He calculates for a moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft.

Before ANAKIN can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator races up through the shaft, cutting the DROIDS in two. ANAKIN lands on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling. OBI-WAN is startled and ignites his lightsaber.

OBI-WAN
 Oh, it's you . . .

 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO activates his oil hose and sprays the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip on the oil.

 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN
 What was that all about?

OBI-WAN
 Well, Artoo has been . . .

ANAKIN
 No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.

OBI-WAN
 Did I say anything?

ANAKIN
 He's trying!

OBI-WAN
 I didn't say anything!

 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. ARTOO rolls away.

 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTER'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way into the main room of the General's Quarters.
At the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move toward the CHANCELLOR.
As they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor's face.

OBI-WAN
 (bows) Chancellor.

ANAKIN
 Are you all right?

PALPATINE
 (quietly) Count Dooku.

PALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi.

OBI-WAN
 (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.

ANAKIN
 I was about to say that.

COUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level.

PALPATINE
 Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.

OBI-WAN
 Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers.

COUNT DOOKU
 Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU.

OBI-WAN
 You won't get away this time, Dooku.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues.

COUNT DOOKU
 I've been looking forward to this.

ANAKIN
 My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.

COUNT DOOKU
 Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

DOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . .

COUNT DOOKU
 (continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better.

As the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force.
ANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General's Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-WAN is choking.
ANAKIN hits the archway.
DOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight.

COUNT DOOKU
 (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don’t use them.

Anakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense.
Anakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness.

 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Anakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's hands. The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord's hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT DOOKU's defeat.

PALPATINE
 Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!

ANAKIN
 I shouldn't . . .

PALPATINE
 Do it!!

ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything.

ANAKIN
 ... I couldn't stop myself.

PALPATINE
 You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

ANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU's lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE.

ANAKIN
 Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

ANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.

PALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists.

PALPATINE
 It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.

The ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators.

PALPATINE
 (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.

ANAKIN
 He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.

PALPATINE
 Leave him, or we'll never make it.

ANAKIN
 His fate will be the same as ours.

ANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators.

 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Prepare for attack.

PILOT
 All batteries fire! Fire!

 INT. BATTLESTATIONS-REPUBLIC CRUISER

Clone gunners fire on the Trade Federation cruiser and take fire in return. Gun emplacements are destroyed. Clone troopers go flying.

 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN carries OBI-WAN to the elevator doors and hits the button. PALPATINE joins him.

ANAKIN
 The elevator's not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . .

ARTOO BEEPS a response to ANAKIN.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) . . . Activate Elevator .

Suddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open. PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the door frame of the elevator. ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!

 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Windows are blown out, droids and equipment are sucked into space.

PILOT
 Reverse stabilizers.

 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

As the ship rolls, spacecraft and equipment CRASH from one side of the ship to the other.
Several objects break through the metal blast doors, causing objects to be sucked into space. ARTOO starts to slide toward one of the small holes.

 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

As the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway.
ANAKIN clings to the doorframe with OBI-WAN on his shoulder, as the Chancellor struggles to join him.

 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO continues to skid and slide toward open space. He swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the BATTLE DROIDS stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. ARTOO BEEPS a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the BATTLE DROIDS. One bolt hits very near him, and he SCREAMS in terror.

 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

PILOT
 Magnetize! Magnetize!

 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding behind him. He falls into a heap of broken battle droid parts and the fighter bounces over him.

 EXT. SPACE-CORUSCANT

The TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER heads straight down toward the planet.

 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with OBI-WAN still on his shoulder.

ANAKIN
 We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast.

PALPATINE climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start running. The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the Chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other.

 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Fire the emergency booster engines.

PILOT
 Leveling out, sir.

 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT ON SIDE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN still carrying OBI-WAN on his back, and PALPATINE run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANAKIN cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and PALPATINE to start sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi's leg. As the ship rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft.

 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-WAN regains consciousness and tries to look around.

ANAKIN
 Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.

OBI-WAN
 Did I miss something?

OBI-WAN looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit. They hear ARTOO BEEPING on Obi-Wan's comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them.

ANAKINN
 Hold on.

OBI-WAN
 What is that?

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then OBI-WAN turns to ANAKIN.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) Oops.

ANAKIN
 Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!

OBI-WAN
 Too late! Jump!

They fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by.

 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE fly through the elevator door and land.

OBI-WAN
 Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. Come on.

ANAKIN
 Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?

 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

As the Federation Cruiser continues to rotate, ARTOO SQUEALS and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken BATTLE DROID PARTS. He looks around then rockets up out of the debris.

 INT. HALLWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lead PALPATINE down a hallway toward the hangar bay.

 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

It is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay.

OBI-WAN
 None of those ships will get us anywhere.

ANAKIN
 I agree.

PALPATINE
 What are we going to do?

ANAKIN
 I don't know.

OBI-WAN
 Don't look at me. I don't know.

ANAKIN and PALPATINE both look to OBI-WAN. He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin's Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side.

ANAKIN
 Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.

OBI-WAN
 We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.

ANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes.

 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them up. ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.

 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PALPATINE are out of breath.

ANAKIN/OBI-WAN
 Well, that was close.

They laugh.

 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

BODYGUARD
 General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway .

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Activate ray shields.

 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

They run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway.

ANAKIN
 Ray shields!

OBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment.

OBI-WAN
 Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.

ANAKIN
 Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.

OBI-WAN
 Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.

ANAKIN
 You're the Master. I'm just a hero.

OBI-WAN
 I'm open to suggestions here.

PALPATINE
 Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.

The Jedi look at each other in disbelief.

ANAKIN
 I say . . . patience.

OBI-WAN
 Patience! That's your plan, is it?

ANAKIN
 Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .

ARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) See! No problem.

Suddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS.
ARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO over.

SUPER BATTLE DROID
 Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.

OBI-WAN
 Do you have a plan B?

 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID GENERAL.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.

A BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him the JEDI'S lightsabers.

OBI-WAN
 That depends upon your point of view. Hah!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.

ANAKIN
 General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .

OBI-WAN
 Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.

OBI-WAN
 Not this time. And this time you won't escape.

ANAKIN
 Artoo.

ARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around.
OBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General's hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Crush them! Make them suffer!

ANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General's hand.

The DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS's TWO BODYGUARDS.

CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the BATTLE DROIDS.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Stay and watch your stations.

OBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous's BODYGUARDS. The BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge.
OBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID BODYGUARD'S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the DROID BODYGUARD in half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the CHANCELLOR away.
ANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor.
OBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces.
ALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

PILOT
 Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Stay on course . . . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN destroy the remaining DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS retrieves one of the BODYGUARD'S staffs and faces OBI-WAN. ANAKIN leaps over a console and lands behind GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 You lose, General Kenobi.

One of the PILOTS stands next to the General.

PILOT
 The ship is breaking up!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 We've run out of time.

OBI-WAN tries to get at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN runs at the General from the opposing side. GENERAL GRIEVOUS turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. It breaks, causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into space. He fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. He swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship.
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast shield closes around where the window used to be.

 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN continues to fight the BATTLE DROIDS. The DROIDS have backed him into a corner. OBI-WAN hides behind a control panel as the DROIDS blast away at him. He jumps up and over the DROIDS, cutting most of them down before he lands. He destroys the DROIDS and joins ANAKIN.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN cut through the rest of the DROIDS as if they were made of butter. PALPATINE stands in shock as he watches the carnage. Droid parts are firing everywhere. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stand back to back and cut down the last of the DROIDS just as there is a huge shudder, followed by more alarms. SPARKS begin to fly outside the windows.

PALPATINE
 The hull is burning up!

 EXT. HULL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE

GENERAL GRIEVOUS detaches his cable and crawls along the exterior hull of the Federation Cruiser, using his magnetized hands and feet. He reaches a row of escape pods and enters an airlock.

 INT. POD BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE

GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the escape pod bay through the hatch. The Droid General goes to a control panel and opens an escape pod.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Time to abandon ship.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls a row of switches, and one by one the escape pods are jettisoned.

 INT. ESCAPE POD-SPACE

He gets in one, the hatch closes, and the escape pod blasts away from the damaged Cruiser.

 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN go over to the navigator's chair.

ANAKIN
 All the escape pods have been launched.

OBI-WAN
 Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

ANAKIN
 You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?

ANAKIN sits in the pilot's chair and sees on a screen the back half of the ship break away. There is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward.

OBI-WAN
 Well?

ANAKIN
 Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.

OBI-WAN and PALPATINE strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN struggles with the controls of the ship. The ship starts to glow, and pieces break off. ARTOO moves in on Palpatine 's controls and assists in flying the cruiser.

OBI-WAN
 Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN
 Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.

OBI-WAN
 Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .

A large part of the ship breaks away.

ANAKIN
 We lost something.

OBI-WAN
 Not to worry, we're still flying half the ship.

ANAKIN
 Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.

OBI-WAN
 Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .

ANAKIN
 What's our speed?

OBI-WAN
 Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . .

ANAKIN points to one of the controls. ARTOO beeps madly.

ANAKIN
 Grab that . . . Keep us level.

OBI-WAN
 Steady. Steady.

ANAKIN
 Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.

OBI-WAN
 Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.

FlRESHIP PILOT
 We'll take you in.

OBI-WAN
 Copy that. Landing strip's straight ahead.

ANAKIN
 We're coming in too hot.

OBI-WAN
 Easy-easy.

The ship leaves a contrail as it streaks across the Coruscant skyline. PALPATINE and OBI-WAN hold on for dear life as the ship shakes and rattles toward an industrial landing platform.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-INDUSTRIAL LANDING PLATFORM-AFTERNOON

A large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approaches as five Fireships spray it with foam. The ship finally makes a rather hard landing.

OBI-WAN
 Another happy landing.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON

The small Jedi Shuttle carrying PALPATINE and the JEDI arrives at the landing platform. There are a DOZEN SENATORS, including BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, and C-PO, waiting for them. PALPATINE, R-D, and ANAKIN get out. OBI-WAN and MACE stay in the doorway of the Jedi Shuttle.

ANAKIN
 (to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master?

OBI-WAN
 Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.

ANAKIN
 Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.

OBI-WAN
 Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .

ANAKIN
 All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.

OBI-WAN
 . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.

ANAKIN
 All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .

OBI-WAN
 Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.

ANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN.
The CHANCELLOR and his entourage approach MACE.

MACE WlNDU
 Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?

PALPATINE
 Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.

MACE WlNDU
 General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.

PALPATINE
 That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.

MACE WlNDU
 Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.

BAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway.

BAIL ORGANA
 Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.

ANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway.

ANAKIN
 Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.

ARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd.

C-PO
 It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.

ARTOO beeps.

C-PO
 (continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON

ANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL ORGANA. R-D and C-PO scoot along ahead of them.

BAIL ORGANA
 The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.

ANAKIN
 I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.

Behind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure.

BAIL ORGANA
 I'll do everything I can with the Senate.

ANAKIN
 Excuse me.

BAIL ORGANA
 Certainly.

ANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.

PADME
 Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.

ANAKIN
 I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.

PADME
 There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.

ANAKIN
 I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.

ANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.

PADME
 Wait, not here . . .

He grabs her again.

ANAKIN
 Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.

PADME
 Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .

ANAKIN
 I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.

PADME
 (playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.

ANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her.

ANAKIN
 Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?

PADME
 I'm just excited to see you.

ANAKIN
 That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?

PADME
 Nothing . . . nothing . . .

ANAKIN
 You're frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what's going on!

PADME begins to cry.

PADME
 You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .

ANAKIN
 . . . Is there someone else?

PADME
 (peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.

ANAKIN
 (sheepish) I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.

PADME
 I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.

ANAKIN
 It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .

PADME
 Something wonderful has happened.

They look at each other for a long moment.

PADME
 (continuing) I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.

ANAKIN is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications of this. He takes her in his arms.

ANAKIN
 That's . . . that's wonderful.

PADME
 What are we going to do?

ANAKIN
 We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.

 EXT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

A small NEIMOIDIAN SHUTTLE lands. BATTLE DROIDS surround the ramp as GENERAL GRIEVOUS descends onto the platform. SUPER BATTLE DROID G approaches.

SUPER BATTLE DROID G
 The planet is secure, sir. The population is under control.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Good. Where is the Separatist Council?

SUPER BATTLE DROID G
 This way, sir ...

GENERAL GRIEVOUS takes the elevator to an upper level. He enters a conference room and presses a series of buttons on the table, and bows.

 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY

A hologram of Darth Sidious appears.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Yes, Lord Sidious.

DARTH SlDIOUS
 General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 It will be done, My Lord.

DARTH SlDIOUS
 The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.

The hologram of Sidious talks to GRIEVOUS about the death of Count Dooku.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 But the loss of Count Dooku?

DARTH SlDIOUS
 His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.

 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT

PADME stands in the balcony brushing her hair. ANAKIN leans against the wall, watching her lovingly.

ANAKIN
 . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.

PADME
 Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.

ANAKIN
 You are so beautiful!

PADME
 It's only because I'm so in love . . .

ANAKIN
 No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

PADME
 So love has blinded you?

ANAKIN
 Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .

PADME
 But it's probably true!

They laugh.

ANAKIN
 I haven't laughed in so long . . .

PADME
 Neither have I.

 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM

The view is strangely distorted and disorienting. PADME is on a table in an alien medical chamber. She is giving birth and is screaming.

PADME
 Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you.

She screams and dies.

 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-BEDROOM-NIGHT

ANAKIN awakens in a panic. He is covered in sweat. He looks over in the bed and sees PADME sound asleep next to him. ANAKIN gets out from under the sheets and sits on the side of the bed. He is breathing heavily. He puts his head in his hands and weeps. He regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs. PADME awakens, realizes Anakin is gone.

PADME
 Anakin??

She gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT

ANAKIN walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. The vast city planet of Coruscant, smoldering from the battle, is spread out before him. He is distraught.
PADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn't look at her.

PADME
 What's bothering you?

ANAKIN
 Nothing . . .

ANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME'S neck, that Anakin gave her when he was a small boy.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you.

PADME
 Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?

ANAKIN
 It was a dream.

PADME
 Bad?

ANAKIN
 Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.

PADME
 And?

ANAKIN
 It was about you.

They look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them.

PADME
 Tell me.

ANAKIN
 It was only a dream.

PADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep breath.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) You die in childbirth . . .

PADME
 And the baby?

ANAKIN
 I don't know.

PADME
 It was only a dream.

ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.

ANAKIN
 . . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.

They embrace, then part.

PADME
 Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.

ANAKIN
 I know ….

PADME
 Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?

ANAKIN
 (suspicious) Have you told him anything?

PADME
 No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.

ANAKIN
 He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!

PADME
 I won't, Anakin.

ANAKIN
 I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY

YODA and ANAKIN sit in Yoda 's room, deep in thought.

YODA
 Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .

ANAKIN
 They are of pain, suffering, death . . .

YODA
 Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

ANAKIN
 Someone . . .

YODA
 . . . close to you?

ANAKIN
 Yes.

YODA
 Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.

ANAKIN
 I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.

YODA
 Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.

ANAKIN
 What must I do, Master Yoda?

YODA
 Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-DAY

ANAKIN hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a Jedi Briefing Room. SEVERAL JEDI are exiting.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY

ANAKIN rushes into the Briefing Room. By the time he reaches the Chamber, the last of the Jedi are leaving. Only OBI-WAN remains at the front of the lecture hall. He is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps.

OBI-WAN
 You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.

ANAKIN
 I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.

OBI-WAN
 In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

ANAKIN
 What's wrong then?

OBI-WAN
 The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.

ANAKIN
 Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.

OBI-WAN
 Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.

ANAKIN
 Be careful of what?

OBI-WAN
 He has requested your presence.

ANAKIN
 What for?

OBI-WAN
 He would not say.

ANAKIN
 He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?

OBI-WAN
 All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.

ANAKIN
 I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?

OBI-WAN
 The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.

 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY

ANAKIN stands with PALPATINE at his window overlooking the vastness of Coruscant. Several buildings have been destroyed. A brown haze hangs over the landscape.

PALPATINE
 Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.

ANAKIN
 The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?

PALPATINE
 They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.

ANAKIN
 I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.

PALPATINE
 There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.

ANAKIN
 With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.

PALPATINE
 Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.

ANAKIN
 Everyone will agree on that.

PALPATINE
 Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.

ANAKIN
 Of course.

PALPATINE
 I need your help, son.

ANAKIN
 What do you mean?

PALPATINE
 I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.

ANAKIN
 I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.

PALPATINE
 Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.

ANAKIN
 For what? I don't understand.

PALPATINE
 To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .

ANAKIN thinks about this.

PALPATINE
 (continuing) Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.

ANAKIN
 Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.

PALPATINE
 I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.

 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA'S OFFICE-DAY

PADME, BAIL ORGANA, and SENATORS MON MOTHMA, FANG ZAR, TERR TANEEL, and GIDDEAN DANU sit in Senator Organa 's office.

BAIL ORGANA
 Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.

FANG ZAR
 When did this happen?

BAIL ORGANA
 The decree was posted this morning.

PADME
 Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?

MON MOTHMA
 Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists.

GIDDEAN DANU
 The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.

BAIL ORGANA
 We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.

EVERYONE looks at each other, a little worried at the implications of what was just said.

TERR TANEEL
 What are you suggesting?

BAIL ORGANA
 I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a Separatist.

MON MOTHMA
 We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.

BAIL ORGANA
 It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.

PADME
 I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.

GlDDEAN DANU
 Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.

MON MOTHMA
 The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.

BAIL ORGANA
 We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .

PADME
 Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid.

BAIL ORGANA
 Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.

MON MOTHMA
 That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.

They ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment.

PADME
 Agreed.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY

ANAKIN stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council Chambers. The door opens.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY

ANAKIN enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is surrounded by the Jedi Council MACE WINDU, EETH KOTH OBI-WAN, YODA, the HOLOGRAMS of PLO KOON and KI-ADI-MUNDI.

MACE
 Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.

ANAKIN
 I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.

YODA
 Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.

ANAKIN
 I understand.

MACE
 You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.

Anakin reacts with anger.

ANAKIN
 What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?

MACE
 Take a seat, young Skywalker.

ANAKIN
 Forgive me, Master.

ANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, speaks.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI
 We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.

YODA
 Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.

OBI-WAN
 It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.

MACE
 We cannot take ships from the front line.

OBI-WAN
 And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.

YODA
 Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI
 What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?

MACE
 It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!

OBI-WAN
 He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.

ANAKIN
 I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.

MACE
 Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.

YODA
 Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.

MACE
 It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.

ANAKIN is disappointed.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. ANAKIN is furious.

ANAKIN
 What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!

OBI-WAN
 Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

ANAKIN
 I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .

OBI-WAN
 But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.

ANAKIN
 That has nothing to do with this.

OBI-WAN
 Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.

ANAKIN
 You mean divided loyalties.

OBI-WAN
 I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.

ANAKIN
 The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.

OBI-WAN
 No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.

ANAKIN
 Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.

OBI-WAN
 I hope so . . .

ANAKIN
 I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.

OBI-WAN
 Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.

ANAKIN
 And?

OBI-WAN
 Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.

ANAKIN
 What situation?

OBI-WAN
 (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.

ANAKIN
 They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!

OBI-WAN
 We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.

ANAKIN
 Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?

OBI-WAN
 This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.

ANAKIN
 The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.

OBI-WAN
 That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.

ANAKIN
 Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.

OBI-WAN
 Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.

ANAKIN
 You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?

OBI-WAN
 The Council is asking you.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

A JEDI GUNSHIP heads for the huge Clone landing platform.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY

YODA, MACE, and OBI-WAN ride in the GUNSHIP as it heads for the Clone landing platform. Mace and Obi-Wan are sitting.

OBI-WAN 
 Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.

YODA
 Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.

MACE
 It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.

OBI-WAN
 He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.

MACE
I wish I did.

OBI-WAN
 With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?

MACE
 So the prophecy says.

YODA
 A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.

OBI-WAN
 He will not let me down. He never has.

YODA
 I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.

The GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the GUNSHIP. MACE and OBI-WAN stand and give him a brief bow then take off in the GUNSHIP.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET

Padme's Speeder pulls up to the landing platform. CAPTAIN TYPHO escorts PADME onto the veranda, where TWO HANDMAIDENS (ELLE and MOTEE) are waiting. PADME turns to CAPTAIN TYPHO.

PADME
 Thank you, Captain.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
 Rest well. My Lady.

CAPTAIN TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background. C-PO is standing nearby.

PADME
 I'll be up in a while.

MOTEE
 Yes, my lady.

C-PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit.

C-PO
 Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?

PADME
 Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.

The golden droid turns and exits.

PADME stands and watches the sunset. The SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward her. She senses something.

ANAKIN
 Beautiful, isn't it?

PADME jumps and turns around.

PADME
 You startled me.

He sits next to her on the bench.

ANAKIN
 How are you feeling?

PADME
 He keeps kicking.

ANAKIN
 He?! Why do you think it's a boy?

PADME
 (laughs) My motherly intuition.

She puts his hand on her belly.

ANAKIN
 Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.

They laugh.

PADME
 I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.

ANAKIN
 I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.

PADME
 Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.

ANAKIN
 They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.

PADME
 Anakin . . .

ANAKIN
 Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.

PADME
 Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?

ANAKIN
 (suspicious) What do you mean?

PADME
 What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?

ANAKIN
 I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!

PADME
 Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.

ANAKIN
 (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!

PADME
 What is it?

ANAKIN
 Nothing.

PADME
 Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.

ANAKIN
 You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.

They look in each other's eyes.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.

PADME is startled at this.

PADME
 I sense there are things you are not telling me.

PADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed.

PADME
 (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.

 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT

ANAKIN lands his speeder and exits.
ANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House.
ANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine's box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore, watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing "Squid Lake."

ANAKIN
 You wanted to see me, Chancellor.

PALPATINE
 Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.

ANAKIN
 At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.

PALPATINE
 I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far … but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.

ANAKIN
 They try.

PALPATINE
 Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us.

ANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him.

PALPATINE
 (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.

ANAKIN
 I'm not sure I understand.

PALPATINE
 You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.

ANAKIN
 I don't think . . .

PALPATINE
 Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?

ANAKIN
 I know they don't trust you . . .

PALPATINE
 Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.

ANAKIN
 I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.

PALPATINE
 Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

ANAKIN doesn't say anything. He simply looks down.

PALPATINE
 (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

ANAKIN
 I don't know ... I don't know what to say.

PALPATINE
 Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.

ANAKIN
 The Jedi use their power for good.

PALPATINE
 Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .

ANAKIN
 . . . evil.

PALPATINE
 . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.

ANAKIN
 The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.

PALPATINE
 And the Jedi don't?

ANAKIN
 The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.

PALPATINE smiles.

PALPATINE
 Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?

ANAKIN
 I'm not sure it's wrong.

PALPATINE
 Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.

ANAKIN is deep in thought.

PALPATINE
 (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?

ANAKIN
 No.

PALPATINE
 I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.

ANAKIN
 He could actually save people from death?

PALPATINE
 The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

ANAKIN
 What happened to him?

PALPATINE
 He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

ANAKIN
 Is it possible to learn this power?

PALPATINE
 Not from a Jedi.

 EXT. KASHYYYK-DAY

A WOOKIEE CATAMARAN flanked by WOOKIEE HELICOPTERS approaches the tree housing the HOLOGRAM AREA.

 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY

YODA and various JEDI speak via hologram. The discussion includes OBI-WAN, MACE, AGEN KOLAR, YODA- KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI
 (holo) Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.

MACE
 (holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.

ANAKIN
 A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.

YODA
 Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.

OBI-WAN
 Does everyone agree?

All the JEDI concur.

ANAKIN
 The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.

They all look at ANAKIN a bit disturbed.

MACE
 (a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI
 Yes, this decision is ours to make.

ANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.

YODA
 A Master is needed, with more experience.

MACE
 Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.

ANAKIN
 He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.

OBI-WAN throws ANAKIN a dirty look.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.

OBI-WAN
 Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.

YODA
 Obi-Wan, my choice is.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI
 I concur. Master Kenobi should go.

YODA
 I agree.

All the JEDI concur.

MACE
 Very well. Council is adjourned.

ANAKIN is angry.

MACE
 (continuing) Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.

 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY

YODA gets out of his chair and walks to the edge of the platform.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE
 The droids have started up their main power generators.

YODA
 Then now the time is, Commander.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE
 Yes, sir.

The battle begins.

 EXT. KASHYYYK-BEACH HEAD-DAY

A WOOKIEE CHIEFTAIN lets out a roar as the Wookiee army rushes to face the DROID ARMY. CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS race across the water against the WOOKIEES and CLONE TROOPERS on the beach. DROID GUNSHIPS provide air support, while a SPIDER DROID emerges from the watery depths. A brave WOOKIEE places an explosive on a SEPARATIST TANK and jumps off just before the TANK EXPLODES. From the Hologram Area, Yoda observes the ongoing battle.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING

Padme's apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded city of Coruscant.

 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-EARLY MORNING

PADME and OBI-WAN sit on one of the couches.

OBI-WAN
 Has Anakin been to see you?

PADME
 Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.

OBI-WAN
 I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.

They laugh.

PADME
 You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?

OBI-WAN
 You should be a Jedi, Padme.

PADME
 You're not very good at hiding your feelings.

OBI-WAN
 It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.

PADME
 Why would he talk to me about his work?

OBI-WAN studies her.

OBI-WAN
 Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.

PADME
 Don't give me that look.

OBI-WAN
 I know how he feels about you.

PADME
 (nervous) What did he say?

OBI-WAN
 Nothing. He didn't have to.

PADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony.

PADME
 I don't know what you're talking about.

OBI-WAN
 I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him.

PADME looks down and doesn't answer.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . .

They stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBI-WAN starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . .

PADME
 Thank you, Obi-Wan.

OBI-WAN
 Please do what you can to help him.

 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-DAY

PADME, MON MOTHMA, and five other Senators (BANA BREEMU, FANG ZAR. CHI EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) sit in Padme's living room. C-PO serves drinks to the guests.

PADME
 We cannot let this turn into another war.

BAIL ORGANA
 Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.

MON MOTHMA
 We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.

PADME
 I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.

BANA BREEMU
 That would be dangerous.

MON MOTHMA
 We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.

PADME
 I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.

GiDDEAN DANU
 Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.

PADME
 The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .

CHI EEKWAY
 Patience, Senator.

FANG ZAR
 We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.

BANA BREEMU
 When you present the "petition of the two thousand" to the Chancellor, things may change.

BAIL ORGANA
 Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the Jedi.

PADME takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk onto a landing platform overlooking a docking bay where THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS and armored weapons, tanks, etc., are being loaded onto a massive REPUBLIC ASSAULT SHIP.

ANAKIN
 You're going to need me on this one, Master.

OBI-WAN
 Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.

OBI-WAN starts to turn and leave.

ANAKIN
 Master!

OBI-WAN stops and ANAKIN walks over to him.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.

OBI-WAN
 You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.

OBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.

ANAKIN
 Well, there's always a first time.

OBI-WAN laughs.

They talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBI-WAN depart.

ANAKIN
 Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN
 Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN heads down a ramp toward the waiting Republic cruiser.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The Republic cruiser lifts off and heads for space.

 INT. REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACE

CLONE TROOPERS stand at attention in rows on the floor of the hangar deck, waiting to board landing craft. OBI-WAN stands next to his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER- talking to SEVERAL CLONE COMMANDERS with their helmets off. A hologram of the planet Utapau is projected by R-G into the middle of the hangar.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY
 Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.

OBI-WAN
 I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY
 Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?

They laugh.

OBI-WAN
 (laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.

OBI-WAN climbs into his Jedi Fighter.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY
 That was Anakin who was late. I believe.

OBI-WAN
 Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY
 I'm counting on you.

 EXT. JEDI FIGHTER-SPACE

OBI-WAN blasts the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER out of the Republic Battle Cruiser and into the hyperspace ring. He heads for the planet Utapau.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR'S TRANSPORT-DAY

The Chancellor's Transport races through the city and heads for the Senate Office Building landing platform. Waiting on the landing platform is a LONE JEDI. The Transport lands, and CHANCELLOR PALPATINE emerges with FOUR ROYAL GUARDS and MAS AMEDDA. The FOUR ROYAL GUARDS move off in another direction as PALPATINE greets ANAKIN, who has been waiting for him.

PALPATINE
 Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?

ANAKIN
 He will soon have Grievous's head.

PALPATINE
 We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.

ANAKIN
 The Council was very sure in its decision.

They exit the landing platform.

 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY

They enter the main hallway of the Senate Office Building. They pass SEVERAL SENATORS, including REPRESENTATIVE JAR JAR BINKS from Naboo.

JAR JAR
 Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .

The Gungan waves to Anakin.

ANAKIN
 Hi, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR
 Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.

Anakin turns back to the Chancellor.

PALPATINE
 There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.

ANAKIN
 Not fit? Why would anyone think that?

PALPATINE
 They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.

ANAKIN
 That's ridiculous. Who?!?

PALPATINE
 (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.

ANAKIN
 That's impossible. I would know.

PALPATINE
 Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.

ANAKIN becomes worried.

PALPATINE
 (continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.

 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM

PADME calls out in pain. OBI-WAN is near her and softly speaks to her.

OBI-WAN
 Save your energy.

PADME
 I can't!

OBI-WAN
 Don't give up, Padme. Don't give up . . .

 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY

ANAKIN is in the living room, working. He sits on the couch where Obi-Wan was sitting. PADME enters and crosses behind him.

ANAKIN
 I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

PADME
 He came by this morning.

ANAKIN
 What did he want?

PADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense.

PADME
 He's worried about you.

ANAKIN
 You told him about us, didn't you?

She continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows.

PADME
 He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.

ANAKIN
 And he's not?

PADME
 You have been moody lately.

ANAKIN
 I'm not moody . . .

PADME
 Anakin! Don't do this again.

ANAKIN
 I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.

PADME
 Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.

ANAKIN
 Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.

PADME
 They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.

ANAKIN
 Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.

PADME
 You expect too much of yourself.

They stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his hand on her belly.

ANAKIN
 I have found a way to save you.

PADME
 Save me?

ANAKIN
 From my nightmares.

PADME
 Is that what's bothering you?

ANAKIN
 I won't lose you, Padme.

PADME
 I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.

ANAKIN
 No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.

PADME looks ANAKIN in the eye.

PADME
 You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.

They embrace and kiss.

 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE

OBI-WAN blasts out of the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER's hyperspace ring and heads for the planet Utapau. The BLUE FIGHTER skims over the planet's surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes.

 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

OBI-WAN lands his ship on a Platform projecting out of the side of a giant sinkhole. All is quiet. A local administrator, TION MEDON, comes out to greet the ship. OBI-WAN climbs out of his Fighter as a SHORT GROUND CREW looks over his ship. On a ledge above the landing platform, GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS watch as OBI-WAN talks to TION MEDON.

TlON MEDON
 Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

OBI-WAN
 Unfortunately, the war.

TlON MEDON
 There is no war here unless you've brought it with you.

OBI-WAN
 With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.

A GROUND CREW rushes out and refuels Obi-Wan’s Fighter. TION MEDON leans close to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly.

TlON MEDON
 He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.

OBI-WAN
 I understand.

TlON MEDON
 The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .

OBI-WAN
 Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.

OBI-WAN starts back toward his Starfighter as TION MEDON leaves the Landing Platform. GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS retreat from the overhead platform. OBI-WAN climbs back into his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER. His Astro Unit (R-G) turns to him


OBI-WAN
 (continuing) Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've made contact.

The little Astro Droid BEEPS a reply.

 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAY

On a high balcony, TION MEDON looks down on the landing platform. A few steps behind him stands one of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS. They watch the canopy lower.

TlON MEDON
 I told you, all he wanted was fuel.

BODYGUARD
 What was his name?

TlON MEDON
 He didn't say.

They watch as the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER takes off.

 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-HALLWAY-DAY

OBI-WAN also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway. He quietly moves farther into the city.

 EXT. UTAPAU STAIRWAY-SINKHOLE RIM-DAY

OBI-WAN quickly rushes up a stairway cut into the side of the sinkhole. It's hard to see him. In an alcove, he carefully surveys the city, then quickly moves on.

 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY

OBI-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. He tries to figure out how he is going to get up there. He hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates.
He comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGON-LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around.
OBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his slight hand movements.

OBI-WAN
 I need transportation.

WRANGLER
 (subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation.

OBI-WAN
 Get it for me.

WRANGLER
 (subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you.

One of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. OBI-WAN walks along the line of DRAGON/LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck.

OBI-WAN
 This one.

The WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him.

WRANGLER
 Boga. She answers to Boga.

OBI-WAN
 Good girl, Boga.

OBI-WAN swings onto the back of the LIZARD. The beast rears up and scurries outside to the edge of the sinkhole.

 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LIZARD-DAY

The LIZARD BOGA rears up on her hind legs again, then climbs the wall of the sheer cliff and starts moving up toward the tenth level. The city appears to be deserted. OBI-WAN is alert to any movement.

 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS stands before the COUNCIL OF SEPARATISTS, including NUTE GUNRAY, RUNE HAAKO. POGGLE THE LESSER, SHU MAI, SAN HILL PO NUDO, WAT TAMBOR, and PASSEL ARGENTE. OBI-WAN hides above the assembly and watches intently.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.

NUTE GUNRAY
 Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.

OBI-WAN is deep in thought.

 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY

The JEDI removes his cloak and jumps down behind the GENERAL.

OBI-WAN
 Hello, there!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed, (to droids) Kill him!

About a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
They stare at each other for a moment.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Enough of this.

The BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi's lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an intense fury.
OBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

OBI-WAN
 Your move.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.

His arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship.

OBI-WAN
 You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!

OBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS's hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies.

OBI-WAN
 I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.

OBI-WAN
 I don't think so.

TWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him.

 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY

More CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS.
The JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on.

 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The chase begins. Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber while riding Boga.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET

The sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office Building. The sky is red.

 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSET

PALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and five other Senators
 NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE.

PALPATINE
 I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.

PADME
 May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?

PALPATINE
 I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .

PADME
 You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.

PALPATINE
 You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.

FANGZAR
 But surely . . .

The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.

PALPATINE
 I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.

PADME
 On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor.

PALPATINE
 I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.

PADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN.

PALPATINE
 (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.

ANAKIN
 What do you mean?

PALPATINE
 They are not to be trusted.

ANAKIN
 Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .

PALPATINE
 These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.

ANAKIN
 I'm sure you're mistaken.

PALPATINE
 I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.

ANAKIN
 I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.

PALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look.

PALPATINE
 Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING

KI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY
 Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we
have begun our attack.

MACE WlNDU
 Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his
intentions.

ANAKIN
 Yes, Master.

ANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY's hologram disappears.

MACE WINDU
 I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI
 If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from
office.

MACE WiNDU
 That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .

Kl-ADI-MUNDI
 . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.

YODA
 To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.

 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

ANAKIN brings news to PALPATINE.

ANAKIN
 Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.

PALPATINE
 We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.

ANAKIN
 I should be there with him.

PALPATINE
 It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?

ANAKIN
 I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.

PALPATINE
 They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.

They walk into the hallway.

ANAKIN
 How do you know the ways of the Force?

PALPATINE
 My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.

They stop.

ANAKIN
 You know the dark side?!?

PALPATINE
 Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. (pausing) They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.

ANAKIN
 I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.

PALPATINE
 Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.

ANAKIN
 What did you say?

PALPATINE
 Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .

ANAKIN
 You're a Sith Lord!

ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.

PALPATINE
 I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.

ANAKIN
 You're wrong!

PALPATINE
 Are you going to kill me?

ANAKIN
 I would certainly like to.

PALPATINE
 I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.

ANAKIN raises his lightsaber to PALPATINE's throat. There is a tense moment, then ANAKIN relaxes, and then turns off his lightsaber.

ANAKIN
 I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.

PALPATINE
 Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?

ANAKIN
 I will quickly discover the truth of all this.

PALPATINE
 You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.

ANAKIN stares at him for a moment.
PALPATINE turns and moves to his office.

PALPATINE
 (continuing) I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you'll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .

PALPATINE sits behind his desk.

 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

OBI-WAN gives the LIZARD a swift kick with the heel of his boot, and they take off down the vertical side of the sheer cliff. As GENERAL GRIEVOUS reaches the landing platform where his shuttle is waiting. OBI-WAN drops onto the top of the starship with his LIZARD. GENERAL GRIEVOUS spins his scooter around and takes off up the vertical cliff face with OBI-WAN and his LIZARD in hot pursuit. The sinkhole is engulfed in a great battle between CLONES and DROIDS. The PEOPLE OF UTAPAU cower in whatever shelter they can find.

 EXT. UTAPAU-MAIN CITY PLAZA-DAY

A LARGE GROUP OF UTAPAUAN TROOPS on LIZARDS attack the DROID ARMY.

OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race through the city at breakneck speed. Passing through battle zones, narrowly escaping EXPLOSIONS, laser bolts, and TROOPS from both sides.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS lays the Scooter down as he goes around sharp turns. Obi-Wan's LIZARD breathes hard as she tries to keep up. They destroy droids, equipment, and clone troops as the JEDI and the GENERAL cut a swath of destruction through the city.

 EXT. UTAPAU-WINDMILLS-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS works his way out onto the rim of the sinkhole, passing some wind blades. The evil Droid General releases the brakes on the lethal blades, and they begin to spin, cutting off Obi-Wan's access to the General. Obi-Wan's LIZARD pulls up short in front of the blades. GENERAL GRIEVOUS laughs and talks into a comlink.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS
 Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.

OBI-WAN sizes up the situation, looking for a way to get to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

The GENERAL accelerates off the edge, activating his claws, drops, and clings to another nearby grouping of windmills. Obi-Wan's LIZARD attempts to jump to follow and barely makes it, almost falling into the precipice below.

 INT. UTAPAU-CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS roars through the stone block tunnel system, riding up on the curved walls as he goes around corners or passes oncoming traffic. OBI-WAN races after the Droid, his LIZARD moving onto the ceiling as they pass traffic. OBI-WAN catches up with GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and they charge through the tunnel, side by side. OBI-WAN grabs the Droid's electronic staff.

 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

Extending from the wall of a small sinkhole is a secret landing platform with a small Federation Fighter sitting in the middle of it. OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race out of the tunnel system and onto the landing platform.

OBI-WAN yanks on the staff, then jumps off his LIZARD onto the General's scooter, knocking both warriors to the ground. GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls out a laser pistol and fires at OBI-WAN. The Jedi reaches out his hand, grabs the General's electro-staff and spins the staff, blocking the laser bolts.

OBI-WAN charges GENERAL GRIEVOUS, swinging the staff and hitting the Droid in the stomach, knocking the gun away. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is hit by the staff, and the Force bends his forearm. He pulls OBI-WAN close to him, and they engage in a furious fight. The electro-staff is knocked away. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat. OBI-WAN struggles to avoid the deadly blows of the brutal, unstoppable Droid.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS's stomachplate is loose. OBI-WAN grabs it and rips it off, revealing the alien life form's guts encased in a bag in the Droid's chest. GENERAL GRIEVOUS grabs OBI-WAN, hoists him over his head, and tosses him across the platform. OBI-WAN dangles off the edge of the platform. He clutches the rim, trying to hold on. The DROID then grabs the staff and charges OBI-WAN. At the last second, OBI-WAN reaches out his hand and uses the Force to retrieve the Droid's laser pistol.

The JEDI fires several blasts in the stomach area of the alien Droid, and he EXPLODES from the inside out. The smoldering Droid falls to the ground. OBI-WAN has killed GENERAL GRIEVOUS. He pulls himself up onto the platform and walks by the destroyed carcass.

OBI-WAN
 So uncivilized . . .

OBI-WAN brushes himself off. He throws the pistol onto the platform, picks up the electro-staff, and jumps on BOGA. The trusty beast rears up and takes off into the tunnel system.

 INT. JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING

MACE and the JEDI (AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, AND SAESEE TIIN) are preparing to board a JEDI GUNSHIP to the CHANCELLOR's office. ANAKIN enters the hangar.

ANAKIN
 Master Windu, I must talk to you.

MACE WiNDU
 What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.

ANAKIN
 He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.

MACE WINDU
 A Sith Lord?

ANAKIN
 Yes. The one we have been looking for.

MACE WiNDU
 How do you know this?

ANAKIN
 He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.

MACE WiNDU
 Are you sure?

ANAKIN
 Absolutely.

MACE WiNDU
 Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.

ANAKIN
 Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.

MACE WiNDU
 For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.

ANAKIN
 I must go, Master.

MACE WiNDU
 No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.

ANAKIN
 Yes, Master.

MACE WiNDU
 Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.

ANAKIN
 Yes, Master.

ANAKIN watches as the JEDI leave in their ship.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY EVENING

(INTERCUT)

PADME is alone in her apartment, thinking of Anakin. ANAKIN sits alone in the Jedi Council Chamber thinking of PADME.

PALPATINE
 (V.O.) You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.

PADME
 I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.

C-PO
 My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?

ANAKIN
 I can't do this ... I can't let her die.

ANAKIN rushes out of the Council Chamber and to his speeder. The hangar door opens and he lifts off.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING

The sky is still blue as a JEDI GUNSHIP lands on the Senate Office Building landing platform.
FOUR JEDI exit the SHUTTLE and enter the Senate Office Building. MACE WINDU, AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, and SAESEE TIIN, like gunfighters out of the Old West, walk through the massive hallway, four across.

 INT. CORUSCANT-LOBBY TO CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

The FOUR JEDI enter the lobby, raising their arms, and send the Chancellor's aide, DAR WAC, flying against the wall, along with TWO REPUBLIC GUARDS. They storm into the Chancellor's office.

 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

MACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.

PALPATINE
 Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.

MACE WINDU
 In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.

MACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.

PALPATINE
 Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

MACE
 The Senate will decide your fate.

PALPATINE
 (burst of anger) I am the Senate!

MACE
 Not yet!

PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.

PALPATINE
 It's treason, then.

A close shot of PALPATINE as the fight begins. Close shots of THREE JEDI getting cut down by PALPATINE. PALPATINE and MACE continue to fight.

Jedi Master MACE WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. PALPATINE is able to use the Force to slam MACE against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down.

ANAKIN lands his speeder, jumps out, and runs down a long corridor toward the Chancellor's office.

In the heat of battle, MACE cuts the window behind the Chancellor's desk, and it crashes away. MACE is forced out onto the ledge, which is twenty stories up. They fight over the precipice. ANAKIN arrives to see PALPATINE and MACE fighting.

They stop as MACE forces PALPATINE to drop his sword. PALPATINE and MACE start yelling at each other.

MACE WINDU
 You are under arrest, My Lord.

PALPATINE
 Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.

MACE WlNDU
 You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .

PALPATINE
 No! No! You will die!

PALPATINE raises his hands, and lightning bolts shoot out. They are blocked by MACE's lightsaber. PALPATINE is pushed back against the window sill.

PALPATINE
 He is a traitor, Anakin.

MACE WlNDU
 He's the traitor. Stop him!

PALPATINE
 Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.

MACE WlNDU
 Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .

PALPATINE
 You are not one of them, Anakin. Don't let him kill me.

MACE WlNDU
 Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .

PALPATINE
 I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.

MACE WlNDU
 Don't listen to him, Anakin.

PALPATINE
 Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .

MACE pushes PALPATINE out to the edge of the ledge. As the Jedi moves closer, the bolts from Palpatine's hands begin to arch back on him. The Chancellor's face begins to twist and distort. His eyes become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.

PALPATINE
 I can't ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer.

MACE WlNDU
 You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.

ANAKIN
 You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.

MACE WlNDU
 He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.

PALPATINE
 I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.

ANAKIN
 It is not the Jedi way . . .

MACE raises his sword to kill the CHANCELLOR.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) He must live . . .

PALPATINE
 Please don't, please don't . . .

ANAKIN
 I need him . . .

PALPATINE
 Please don't . . .

ANAKIN
 NO!!!

Just as MACE is about to slash PALPATINE, ANAKIN steps in and cuts off the Jedi's hand holding the lightsaber.

As MACE stares at ANAKIN in shock, PALPATINE springs to life.
The full force of Palpatine's powerful Bolts blasts MACE. He attempts to deflect them with his one good hand, but the force is too great. As blue rays engulf his body, he is flung out the window and falls twenty stories to his death. No more screams. No more moans. PALPATINE lowers his arm.

PALPATINE
 Power! Unlimited power!

His face has changed into a horrible mask of evil. ANAKIN looks on in horror. PALPATINE cackles.

ANAKIN
 What have I done?

ANAKIN sits.

PALPATINE
 You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

ANAKIN
 I will do whatever you ask.

PALPATINE
 Good.

ANAKIN
 Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.

PALPATINE
 To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.

ANAKIN kneels before PALPATINE.

ANAKIN
 I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.

PALPATINE
 Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.

ANAKIN
 Thank you. my Master.

PALPATINE
 Rise, Darth Vader.

Palpatine moves over to his desk.

 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY

YODA winces, closes his eyes, and holds his head. He feels a disturbance in the Force.

 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EVENING

PALPATINE is putting on his dark cloak
 he is now fully DARTH SIDIOUS.

PALPATINE
 Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.

ANAKIN
 I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.

PALPATINE
 Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?

ANAKIN
 I understand, Master.

PALPATINE
 We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.

ANAKIN
 What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?

PALPATINE
 Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE ENTRY-NIGHT

ANAKIN goes to the Jedi Temple with a battalion of Clone Troopers.

 EXT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-LANDIXG PLATFORM-DAY

The battle between the CLONES and the DROIDS rages throughout the sinkhole. OBI-WAN rides up to CLONE COMMANDER CODY.

OBI-WAN
 Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY
 Very good, sir.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY starts to move away, then remembers something and returns to OBI-WAN.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY
 (continuing) Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this.

He hands OBI-WAN his lightsaber, and the LIZARD rears up.

OBI-WAN
 Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY
 Yes, sir!

OBI-WAN and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole.
The battle rages throughout the city. CLONE COMMANDER CODY (,) takes out his comlink and listens to the HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS as, far below, OBI-WAN can been seen battling DROIDS on a landing platform.

DARTH SlDIOUS
 Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY
 It will be done, My Lord.

The HOLOGRAM disappears, and CLONE COMMANDER CODY gestures to a nearby Clone Trooper.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY
 Blast him!

The battle rages all around OBI-WAN. DROIDS and CLONES are everywhere. OBI-WAN is riding on a LIZARD, cutting down DROIDS as he races across the battlefield. Suddenly a volley of laser blasts from behind him knocks him and his LIZARD off the wall of the sinkhole. He looks around just in time to see his CLONE TROOPS are firing on him.
OBI-WAN falls hundreds of feet to the bottom of the water-filled sinkhole.

 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN

The sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of Mygeeto. A battle rages. Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. KI-ADI-MUNDi uses his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE COMMANDER BACARA () exits a Gunship near the entrance to the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the city, then gets a message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as a HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the palm of his hand. He moves further into the shadows.

DARTH SlDIOUS
 Commander  . . .

CLONE COMMANDER BACARA
 Yes, sir.

DARTH SlDIOUS
 The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.

CLONE COMMANDER BACARA
 It will be done, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city, where KI-ADI-MUNDI is leading the charge. The clones stop. KI-ADI-MUNDI turns around and is blasted by clone fire. He's killed before he can defend himself.

 EXT. FELUCIA-FOREST-DAY

A column of CLONE WALKERS marches across the forest floor. The STRANGE CALLS of the alien forest creatures of FELUCIA suddenly stop. The Jedi AAYLA SECURA and her CLONE TROOPS brace for an ambush.

AAYLA
 Steady. . . . steady . . .

They all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER BLY moves up behind the Jedi.

AAYLA
 (continuing) Bly, do you think they're Droids?

BLY
 No.

BLY blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER CLONES fire on her as she hits the ground.

Another Jedi, BARRISS OFFEE, is cutting down a patrol of DROIDS when a CLONE WALKING TANK and SEVEN CLONE TROOPERS round a corner and blast the Jedi away.

 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY

YODA drops his gimer stick, clutches his chest, and rests against a wall.

 EXT. KASHYYYK-EDGE OF VILIAGE-DAY

The battle appears to be over. WOOKIEES stack destroyed Droids while CLONES assess the damage to their equipment. A Jedi, LUMINARA UNDULI, talks with EIGHT CLONE OFFICERS standing in a circle around her. Suddenly they reveal their hidden pistols and blast her before she can react.

The Jedi QUINLAN VOS is riding on top of a CLONE TURBO TANK. The main cannon of a second tank slowly swings to point right at him and a COUPLE OF CLONES.
The cannon fires, and QUINLAN VOS and the CLONES disappear in a huge EXPLOSION.

 INT. CATO NEIMOIDIA-COCKPIT CLONE FIGHTER-DAY

The CLONE PILOT watches a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS
 Execute Order Sixty-Six.

CLONE PILOT
 It will be done, My Lord.

 INT. CATO NEIMOIDIA-JEDI STARFIGHTER-DAY

PLO KOON heads his ship toward a battle on a landing platform.

PLO KOON
 There they are. Land on the nearest platform.

 EXT. CATO XEIMOIDIA-JEDI STARFIGHTER-DAY

The FOUR CLONE PILOTS with PLO KOON drop back and blast him out of the sky.

 EXT. SALEUCAMI-FOREST

Three Speeder Bikes race through the forest. A Jedi, STASS ALLIE is in the lead. The TWO CLONES following her drop back and blast her, causing her to crash in a huge EXPLOSION.

 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-NIGHT

DARTH SIDIOUS stands alone in his private office, illuminated only from a hologram projector beam from above. A small HOLOGRAM OF COMMANDER GREE stands in front of him.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE
 Yes, My Lord.

DABTH SIDIOUS
 The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.

 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL BALCONY-DAY

A vista of waterways, high green mesas, and giant tree cities serves as a backdrop for the fierce battle, CLONES AND WOOKIEES against TRADE FEDERATION DROID ARMIES, with treaded tank-like vehicles. CLONE COMMANDER GREE holds his comlink.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE
 It will be done, My Lord.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE snaps his comlink shut.

YODA watches from the balcony. The battle rages as CLONES and WOOKIEES attack DROIDS coming across the water on CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL stand on either side of the Jedi Master as he watches the battle below. CLONE COMMANDER GREE and ONE OFFICER walk onto the balcony toward YODA. YODA stands looking over the battlefield below. When they are close enough, the CLONES reveal their weapons and fire.

But faster than the CLONES can reveal their weapons, YODA ignites his lightsaber, leaps in the air, and beheads both CLONES. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL fire their weapons as more CLONES enter the hall. The Wookiees call out to YODA to follow them. CHEWBACCA picks YODA up and carries him away.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT

A JEDI is surrounded and gunned down by CLONE TROOPERS.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT

ANAKIN walks through the Jedi Temple, where he finds and kills SHAAK TI.
He exits Shaak Ti's room and enters a hallway, where the battle is taking place.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BATTLE-NIGHT

ANAKIN enters a room full of YOUNGLINGS huddled in a corner.

YOUNGLINGS
 Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?

ANAKIN looks back at them with a stern expression on his face and ignites his lightsaber.

 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-PRE-DAWN

C-PO and PADME look out the apartment window.

C-PO
 The Chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don't worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right.

PADME bursts into tears.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN

The city planet is covered in a hazy glow. A column of black smoke can be seen rising in the distance. BAIL ORGANA's Speeder flies overhead, straight toward the smoke.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LANDING PLATFORM-PRE-DAWN

The Jedi Temple is on fire. Large plumes of smoke billow toward the sky as BAIL ORGANA lands his Speeder on a Jedi Temple platform. FOUR CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance to the Temple. They lower their guns as BAIL gets out of his Speeder and walks toward them.

BAIL ORGANA
 What's going on here?!?

CLONE SERGEANT
 There's been a rebellion. Don't worry, sir, the situation is under control.

The CLONES bar the Senator from entering the Temple.

CLONE SERGEANT
 (continuing) I'm sorry, sir. No one is allowed entry.

The CLONES point their guns at BAIL and cock them.

CLONE SERGEANT
 (continuing) It's time for you to leave, sir.

BAIL ORGANA
 And so it is.

BAIL reluctantly heads hack toward his Speeder. Suddenly, several SHOTS RING OUT. BAIL turns and sees a ten-year-old Jedi, ZETT JUKASSA, fighting the CLONES. Several more CLONES join in the fight, followed by CLONE COMMANDER APPO (), who points at BAIL.

CLONE COMMANDER APPO
 Get him! Shoot him!

SEVERAL CLONES start firing at BAIL. The Senator jumps for cover behind his Speeder, starting the engines and pulling out his laser
pistol.

The YOUNG JEDI cuts down several CLONES, including APPO, before he is overrun and shot.

The Speeder takes off with BAIL clinging to the side. The CLONES fire at it as it disappears into the cityscape.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN

BAIL ORGANA struggles to pull himself into the Speeder as it races along through the cityscape. Finally, he climbs in, just as the Speeder is about to hit a building. BAIL steers clear of the building and races away.

 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER SINKHOLE-DAY

The Jedi dives below the surface amid a barrage of laser fire. He dives deeper under the water, fumbling in his utility belt for a breathing device. He finds it and puts it in his mouth. He swims underwater until the CLONE TROOPS give up and stop filing.

 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER CAVES-DAY

OBI-WAN removes the breathing apparatus after coming up from underwater. He starts to climb the rock wall.

OBI-WAN climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE SEEKER DRONES pop out of the water with their searchlights glowing. OBI-WAN presses himself against the wall of the smaller cave as the TWO SEEKER DRONES search the grotto. One of the SEEKERS begins to enter the cave in which OBI-WAN is hiding. OBI-WAN presses further into the wall. The light shines on the opposite wall and moves to the back of the cave, illuminating a huge NOS MONSTER. OBI-WAN holds his breath. The SEEKER is confused for a moment, then the NOS MONSTER lunges at the SMALL DROID and consumes it in one bite.

The NOS MONSTER'S lunge takes him past OBI-WAN, out of the cave, and into the water.

The SECOND SEEKER shines its light on the NOS MONSTER as the evil creature tries to grab the LITTLE DRONE. OBI-WAN slinks off toward the back of the cave. He comes upon a nest of BABY NOS MONSTERS. They SCREECH and make horrible sounds. OBI-WAN jumps over them and continues on his way through the tunnel system.

 EXT. KASHYYYK-LAKE ON VILLAGE EDGE-DUSK

CLONES in modified one-man AT-ST's and Swamp Speeders flash their searchlights across the gloomy lake. The light of one of the AT-ST's spots something floating in the water. It is what's left of a Wookiee catamaran. The body of a dead Wookiee (TARFFUL) is lying across the stern of the wreckage of the flying boat. There is some movement on the boat. The CLONE SERGEANT on the AT-ST fires a warning shot past the boat.

AT-ST CLONE SERGEANT
 Everyone out of there!

A CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all directions.

CREATURE
 Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee. (crazy little laugh)

CLONE SERGEANT
 Did you find something?

CREATURE
 It's nothing, nothing. (laughs)

CLONE SERGEANT
 It's nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.

CLONE TROOPER
 Yes, sir.

Suddenly, CHEWBACCA climbs up behind the AT-ST CLONE, dripping wet, and throws the CLONE SERGEANT into the water. CHEWIE BARKS.

CREATURE
 Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be.

TARFFUL jumps up in the boat, and the CREATURE takes off his hair. It is Yoda.

YODA
 Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.

YODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. TARFFUL climbs onto the AT-ST with CHEWBACCA. YODA is out of the water and putting his robes back on.

YODA
 (continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .

YODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CAN-CELL appears. YODA jumps on the insect's back and they take off. The WOOKIEES follow on the AT-ST. The CLONES continue to search the swamp.

 EXT. KASHYYYK-HILLS OVERLOOKING LAKE-DUSK

The AT-ST marches up the hill and stops. The WOOKIEES jump down. YODA lands on CAN-CELL nearby. CHEWBACCA goes to a tree and pulls down one of its branches.
The ground opens up, and a small WOOKIEE ESCAPE POD rises into the field. YODA opens the door of the pod.

YODA
 Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.

The Wookiees BARK as the Jedi climbs into the WOOKIEE POD and takes off into the dusk sky.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND STARSHIP LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

BAIL ORGANA walks out of a tunnel onto a huge underground platform with two of his AIDES. He is stopped by TWO ROYAL GUARDS.

ROYAL GUARD
 Identification . . .

BAIL ORGANA
 Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.

BAIL and his AIDES hand them their ID cards. The ROYAL GUARDS check them over and give them back, then BAIL and his CREW walk on board his Starship.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The platform rises to the surface of the Office Building. The ALDERAAN STARCRUISER takes off and disappears into the crisp morning sky.

 INT ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY

BAIL ORGANA is greeted by CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO ALDERAAN TROOPERS.

BAIL ORGANA
 Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon?

CAPTAIN ANTILLES
 Yes, sir. We've encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command.

BAIL ORGANA
 That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.

 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LATE DAY

OBI-WAN hides from a group of CLONE TROOPERS.

CLONE CAPTAIN
 Did you find Kenobi?

CLONE TROOPER
 No one could have survived that fall.

He watches them pass.

CLONE CAPTAIN
 Start loading your men on the ship.

CLONE TROOPER
 Yes, sir.

OBI-WAN tries to sneak back to the secret platform, down a flight of stairs.

 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY

OBI-WAN makes his way out of the cave and onto General Grievous's secret landing platform. He runs to the Starfighter and climbs into the one-man ship. The Starfighter takes off and disappears into the sky.

 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE

OBI-WAN flies away from the planet Utapau in General Grievous's tiny Starfighter.

 INT. GENERAL GRIEVOUS'S STARFIGHTER-SPACE

OBI-WAN activates the controls on the Starfighter. He punches in several coordinates and codes. A BEEPING SOUND is heard. It quickly speeds up until it is a steady tone. OBI-WAN speaks into his comlink.

OBI-WAN
 Emergency Code Nine Thirteen ... I have no contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . .

A BURST OF STATIC is heard- and a FUZZY HOLOGRAM image appears.

BAIL
 (hologram) . . . Kenobi . . .

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) I've locked on. Repeat.

The FUZZY HOLOGRAM image comes into focus, and it is BAIL ORGANA.

BAIL ORGANA
 Master Kenobi??

OBI-WAN
 Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me ... I need help.

BAIL ORGANA
 We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We're sending you our coordinates.

 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME’SAPARTMENT-PRE-DAWN

PADME stands before the window of her living room, watching the plume of smoke from the Jedi Temple. C-PO enters from the bedroom.

C-PO
 My Lady, there's a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda.

PADME turns and rushes to the bedroom.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN

THREEPIO walks out to ANAKIN's ship and talks with ARTOO. ARTOO beeps.

THREEPIO
 Hush! Not so loud!

PADME rushes onto the veranda as ANAKIN exits his GREEN JEDI FIGHTER. They embrace.

PADME
 Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.

ANAKIN
 I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.

PADME
 Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?

C-PO continues to talk to R-D on the GREEN FIGHTER.

C-PO
 What is going on?

ARTOO SQUEAKS and BEEPS.

C-PO
 (continuing) You can't be anymore confused than I am.

ANAKIN
 The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .

PADME
 I can't believe that!

ANAKIN
 I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.

C-PO leans over and whispers to ARTOO.

C-PO
 Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids.

ARTOO BEEPS rather loudly. C-PO puts his fingers to his lips.

C-PO
 (continuing) Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.

ARTOO BEEPS quietly.

C-PO
 (continuing) Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.

PADME
 Anakin, what are you going to do?

ANAKIN looks down for a moment and then walks away from Padme.

ANAKIN
 I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.

ANAKIN turns and walks back to Padme.

PADME
 What about Obi-Wan?

ANAKIN
 I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.

PADME
 How could this have happened?

ANAKIN
 The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.

PADME stands and reacts ever so slightly.

PADME
 What are you saying?

ANAKIN
 You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.

PADME
 What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?

ANAKIN
 That won't happen. I won't let it.

PADME
 Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.

ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.

ANAKIN
 Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise.

They kiss.

ANAKIN
 (continuing) Please, wait for me.

PADME
 I will.

ANAKIN gets into his Fighter as THREEPIO backs away.

C-PO
 (to Artoo) Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.

ARTOO beeps.

C-PO
 (continuing) Take care, my little friend.

ARTOO BEEPS a good-bye, and the fighter takes off. PADME is left alone on the veranda. She starts to cry. THREEPIO comes up to her.

C-PO
 (continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do?

PADME
 No thank you, Threepio.

G-PO
 A snack, perhaps?

PADME
 No.

THREEPIO starts to move off.

C-PO
 I feel so helpless.

 EXT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-SPACE

OBI-WAN's ship docks with Bail Organa's Starcruiser.

 INT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY

The door to the main hallway slides open. OBI-WAN enters and is greeted by YODA and BAIL ORGANA. The three walk down the hallway.

BAIL ORGANA
 You made it.

YODA
 Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.

OBI-WAN
 You were attacked by your Clones, also?

YODA
 With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.

OBI-WAN
 How many other Jedi managed to survive?

YODA
 Heard from no one, have we.

BAIL ORGANA
 I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda.

OBI-WAN
 Have we had any contact from the Temple?

YODA
 Received a coded retreat message, we have.

BAIL ORGANA
 It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . .

OBI-WAN
 Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.

BAIL ORGANA
 It's too dangerous to return.

YODA
 Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?

OBI-WAN
 Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.

YODA
 I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LAVA FIELDS-DAY

Workers move across the lava beds, gathering the magma. A column of aliens riding giant MUSTAFAR FLEAS marches forward.

 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

A HOLOGRAM of DARTH SIDIOUS is in the center of the room. NUTE GUNRAY and the REST OF THE SEPARATIST COALITION watch SIDIOUS.

NUTE GUNRAY
 The plan has gone as you had promised, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS
 You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.

The hologram disappears.

 INT. CRUISER-COCKPIT

The Republic Cruiser heads toward Coruscant. OBI-WAN, BAIL, YODA, and TWO PILOTS sit in the cockpit.

PILOT
 We are receiving a message from the Chancellor's office, sir.

BAIL ORGANA
 Send it through.

PILOT
 Yes, sir.

The PILOT pushes some buttons. MAS AMEDDA appears on screen.

MAS AMEDDA
 Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress.

BAIL ORGANA
 Tell the Chancellor I will be there.

MAS AMEDDA
 Very well. He will be expecting you.

MAS AMEDDA's image disappears from the screen.

BAIL ORGANA
 It could be a trap.

OBI-WAN
 No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.

YODA
 If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY

OBI-WAN, BAIL, and YODA land on Coruscant. The elevator door opens, and they step out.

GUARD
 Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance?

BAIL ORGANA
 Certainly.

GUARD
 Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi.

OBI-WAN
 It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.

GUARD
 It would be better if they stayed with you.

BAIL and his AIDES go into the Senate. YODA and OBI-WAN head for the Jedi Temple.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-JEDI STARFIGHTER-SPACE

ANAKIN's Jedi Starfighter heads for the hazy blood-red planet of Mustafar.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

ANAKIN flies over the volcanoes of Mustafar and lands his Jedi Starfighter on a complex of Landing Platforms. His cockpit opens as R-D pops from the ship with a happy BEEP.

ANAKIN
 Artoo . . . stay with the ship.

ARTOO lets out a sad little BEEP and moves back toward the ship.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

ANAKIN, putting on his hood, walks across a walkway upon arriving on Mustafar.

 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN appears in the doorway of the control center.

NUTE GUNRAY
 Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.

Everyone in the room looks to him as he raises his hand toward a control panel, and all the exits close. The confused SEPARATISTS look around in bewilderment.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LATE DAY

Smoke from the smoldering shell of the Jedi Temple fills the air with a brown haze.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MAIN ENTRANCE-LATE DAY

A DOZEN CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance of the Jedi Temple. Suddenly there is a flash of a lightsaber, a flurry of confusion, and all of the Clone Troopers are dead on the floor. YODA and OBI-WAN stand in the middle of the carnage.

OBI-WAN
 There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.

YODA
 Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE BUILDING-SUNSET

The awesome Senate Building looms over the city. The endless traffic continues to clutter the skyline.

 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET

The Chancellor is in the podium in the center of the vast arena giving a speech. MAS AMEDDA stands to the right of SIDIOUS. BAIL ORGANA walks through the hallway of the Main Senate Chamber. He enters the Senate Pod of Naboo and sits next to PADME. JAR JAR, CAPTAIN TYPHO and TWO HANDMAIDENS are in the pod also.

PALPATINE
 . . . and the Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.

BAIL ORGANA
 I was held up. What's happening?

PADME
 The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.

BAIL ORGANA
 That's not true!

PADME
 He's been presenting evidence all afternoon.

BAIL ORGANA
 And the Senate will go along with it, just like they always do.

PALPATINE
 The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. (applause) Any collaborators will suffer the same fate.

(applause)

These have been trying times, but we have passed the test.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-SUNSET

YODA and OBI-WAN make their way through the Temple, avoiding the HUNDREDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. They use the Force to distract the CLONES when they can.
YODA and OBI-WAN walk through the ruins of the Temple until they come across the bodies of some students.

OBI-WAN
 Not even the younglings survived.

YODA
 Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.

OBI-WAN
 . . .Who?? Who could have done this?

 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber, NUTE and the OTHERS panic. The DROIDS at the controls and the GUARDS grab their weapons, but it is too late. They are cut down in a flash. The Separatists bang on the doors, and NUTE and RUNE HAAKO flee under a table.

ANAKIN, stone-faced, moves through the room like the grim reaper. Bodies drop everywhere. SCREAMS are cut short as the head of the Banking Clan dies.

Then POGGLE THE LESSER loses his head; WAT TAMBOR, SHU MAI, and the REST OF THE SEPARATISTS run into the conference room.

 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET

PALPATINE
 The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger.

Applause.

 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

In the hallway, ANAKIN cuts down DROIDS and SEPARATISTS alike. He is unstoppable. ANAKIN turns his head-his eyes are yellow.

 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET

PALPATINE continues his speech at the podium.

PALPATINE
 The war is over. (applause) The Separatists have been defeated, (applause) and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.

There is a long period of APPLAUSE.

PADME
 Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy.

PALPATINE
 In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.

There is a loud, sustained CHEER from the Senate. BAIL ORGANA and PADME sit, dumbfounded.

PALPATINE
 (continuing) An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . .

The Senate CHEERS again. BAIL and PADME are devastated. PADME begins to cry.

PALPATINE
 (continuing) An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . .

The Senate APPLAUDS.

PADME
 So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . .

BAIL ORGANA
 We cannot let this happen.

He starts to stand up. PADME stops him.

PADME
 Not now! There will be a time.

 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-CONFERENCE ROOM-DAY

After everyone in the Main Control Room is dead, ANAKIN moves to the small conference room where WAT TAMBOR. SHU MAI, and some OTHER SEPARATISTS are hiding. RUNE HAAKO tries to run but is trapped by a dead-end as ANAKIN advances.

RUNE HAAKO
 Stop! Enough, this is not right!

RUNE is cut down. NUTE GUNRAY crawls out from under the table and opens the Main Door, allowing DESTROYER DROIDS to enter. WAT TAMBOR is cut down, along with SHU MAI. DESTROYER DROIDS appear in the doorway and blast away, causing total destruction. When the firing is over, ANAKIN is gone. Blown away? No. ANAKIN drops from the ceiling behind the TWO DROIDS and cuts them to pieces before they know what hit them.

 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-HALLWAY-DAY

NUTE GUNRAY is the last Separatist leader alive. ANAKIN moves on to find NUTE GUNRAY hiding in an alcove.

NUTE GUNRAY
 The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace ... we only want . . .

NUTE GUNRAY is cut down in midsentence.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COMPUTER ROOM-NIGHT

OBI-WAN stands in a large computer area as YODA looks on, in the hatchway to the Main Control Center.

OBI-WAN
 I've recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

YODA
 Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.

 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-CONTROL CENTER-NIGHT

OBI-WAN enters the Main Control Center with YODA and heads for the hologram area.

OBI-WAN
 Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . .

YODA
 If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.

OBI-WAN
 I must know the truth, Master.

OBI-WAN moves to a panel and flips some switches. He sees a HOLOGRAM of ANAKIN slaughtering JEDI, including the YOUNG ONES. OBI-WAN and YODA react.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) It can't be . . . It can't be . . .

As ANAKIN surveys the carnage, a DARK-ROBED SITH LORD enters. ANAKIN turns to DARTH SIDIOUS and kneels before him.

ANAKIN
 The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.

DARTH SlDIOUS
 Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?

ANAKIN
 Yes, My Master.

DARTH SlDIOUS
 Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.

OBI-WAN watches in horror. Tears well up in his eyes.

OBI-WAN
 I can't watch any more.

OBI-WAN switches off the hologram. The TWO JEDI stand in silence for a few moments.

YODA
 Destroy the Sith, we must.

OBI-WAN
 Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.

YODA
 To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.

OBI-WAN
 He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.

YODA
 Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.

OBI-WAN
 How could it have come to this?

YODA
 To question, no time there is.

OBI-WAN
 I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.

YODA
 Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN
 May the Force be with you, Master Yoda.

 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-AFTERNOON

A DC Intergalactic Speeder pulls up to the veranda landing of Padme's apartment.

 EXT. CORUSCANT -PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-AFTERNOON

The cockpit of the sleek yellow Galactic Speeder opens, and a HOODED FIGURE emerges and walks onto the veranda. An ALARM GOES OFF deep in the apartment. The FIGURE stops before a security curtain that protects the veranda. C-PO enters the veranda and approaches the FIGURE.

C-PO
 Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.

The security curtain disappears, and the FIGURE lifts his hood. It is OBI-WAN. The alarm stops sounding.

OBI-WAN
 Has Anakin been here . . . ?

C-PO
 Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.

PADME comes down the stairs in a robe. THREEPIO leaves.

PADME
 Master Kenobi . . .

She embraces Obi-Wan.

PADME
 (continuing) Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive.

OBI-WAN
 The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .

PADME
 I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone.

OBI-WAN
 I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.

PADME
 The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.

OBI-WAN
 No. Padme . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.

PADME
 The Sith!?!

OBI-WAN
 I'm here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?

PADME
 Yesterday.

OBI-WAN
 And do you know where he is now?

PADME
 (looks down) No.

OBI-WAN
 Padme, I need your help. He's in grave danger.

PADME
 From the Sith?

OBI-WAN
 From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side.

PADME
 You're wrong! How could you even say that?

OBI-WAN
 I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.

PADME
 Not Anakin! He couldn't!

OBI-WAN
 He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.

PADME
 I don't believe you ... I can't.

OBI-WAN
 Padme, I must find him.

PADME
 You're going to kill him, aren't you?

OBI-WAN
 He has become a very great threat.

As PADME moves to sit down, she reveals her pregnancy.

PADME
 I can't . . .

OBI-WAN
 Anakin is the father, isn't he?

PADME looks away.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) I'm so sorry.

OBI-WAN turns and leaves as PADME stares transfixed, not knowing what to do. She is worried and tormented. OBI-WAN takes off in the Speeder. She studies the japor snippet that is hanging around her neck.

 INT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

R-D waits forlornly for his Master in front of the Jedi Starfighter.

 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

A small Naboo Skiff rests on a landing platform in the vast congestion of Coruscant. PADME gets out of her Speeder, followed by CAPTAIN TYPHO and C-PO.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
 My Lady, let me come with you.

PADME
 There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.

TYPHO bows.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
 As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.

PADME
 I'll be all right, Captain.

He goes to the speeder and gets in.

PADME
 (continuing) This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.

C-PO
 Oh, dear.

TYPHO takes off and PADME and THREEPIO board the small NABOO SKIFF. A shadow moves out from under the SKIFF. It is OBI-WAN. He quickly jumps on the retracting ramp as the SKIFF takes off.

 INT. NABOO SKIFF

THREEPIO chatters away as PADME breaks down in tears, the painful reality sinking in.

C-PO
 Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business.

OBI-WAN stows away on Padme's ship. The ship lifts from the landing platform and heads into the traffic lanes.

 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-SUNSET

A HOLOGRAM OF ANAKIN appears before PALPATINE in his office at the bottom of the Senate Arena.

DARTH VADER
 The Separatists are taken care of, My Master.

DARTH SlDIOUS
 It is finished, then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. You have done well, Lord Vader.

DARTH VADER
 Thank you, My Master.

 INT. MUSTAFAR-COXFERENCE ROOM-DAY

A Hologram of Sidious speaks with Anakin in the Mustafar control room.

DARTH SlDIOUS
 Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.

DARTH VADER
 Very good, My Lord.

ANAKIN sees Padme's ship arriving on the screen and goes out to meet her.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The sleek NABOO SKIFF lands on the Mustafar landing platform near Anakin's GREEN STARFIGHTER. ANAKIN runs up to the SKIFF as the ramp lowers. PADME runs to him.

ANAKIN
 Padme, I saw your ship . . .

They embrace.

PADME
 Oh, Anakin!

ANAKIN
 It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?

PADME
 I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

ANAKIN
 What things?

PADME
 He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.

ANAKIN
 Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

PADME
 He cares about us.

ANAKIN
 Us??!

PADME
 He knows . . . He wants to help you.

ANAKIN
 Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.

PADME
 Anakin, all I want is your love.

ANAKIN
 Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.

PADME
 At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.

ANAKIN
 I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.

PADME
 Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.

ANAKIN
 Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.

PADME
 I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

ANAKIN
 I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.

PADME
 I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I
can't follow.

ANAKIN
 Because of Obi-Wan?

PADME
 Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.

ANAKIN
 (seeing Obi-Wan) Liar!

PADME turns around and. sees OBI-WAN standing in the doorway of the Naboo Cruiser.

PADME
 No!

ANAKIN
 You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!

PADME
 NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...

ANAKIN reaches out, and PADME grabs her throat as she starts to choke.

OBI-WAN
 Let her go, Anakin.

ANAKIN
 What have you and she been up to?

OBI-WAN
 Let her go!

ANAKIN releases his grip on the unconscious PADME and she crumples to the ground.

ANAKIN
 You turned her against me.

OBI-WAN
 You have done that yourself.

ANAKIN
 You will not take her from me.

ANAKIN throws off his cloak.

OBI-WAN
 Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.

OBI-WAN flings off his cloak.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.

They circle each other until OBI-WAN is near PADME. He places his hand on her.

ANAKIN
 Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.

OBI-WAN
 Your new Empire?

ANAKIN
 Don't make me kill you.

OBI-WAN
 Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.

ANAKIN
 If you're not with me, you're my enemy.

OBI-WAN
 Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.

(ignites his lightsaber)

ANAKIN
 You will try.

ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.

ANAKIN lashes out at OBI-WAN, and they begin a ferocious sword fight. ANAKIN throws CONTAINERS at OBI-WAN using the Force.
They work their way off the landing platform and into the main entry hallway. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN, and OBI-WAN drops to a lower level.
ARTOO BEEPS his concern and rushes to the unconscious PADME's aid.

 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT

YODA enters, using the Force to throw two RED GUARDS against the wall, knocking them unconscious. DARTH SIDIOUS turns his chair toward YODA. MAS AMEDDA stands behind SIDIOUS's desk.

YODA
 I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.

DARTH SlDIOUS
 Master Yoda, you survived.

YODA
 Surprised?

DARTH SlDIOUS
 Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.

The Dark Lord raises his arms, and LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot out, surrounding YODA.
YODA is picked up and thrown across the room, hitting the wall and sliding down in a crumpled heap. DARTH SIDIOUS chuckles.

 INT. MUSTAFAR-PASSAGES TO MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move their fight toward the main control center. As the laser swords fly, bits of the hallway are cut up. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump and use every trick in the Jedi book.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO CRUISER-DAY

R-D, tries to drag PADME on board the Naboo Cruiser. C-PO pokes his head out of the ship's doorway.

C-PO
 What are you doing? You're going to hurt her. Wait!!

C-PO starts down the ramp.

 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT

MAS AMEDDA leaves the room. PALPATINE approaches a stunned YODA.

DARTH SlDIOUS
 I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.

YODA
 Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.

YODA uses the Force to throw DARTH SIDIOUS back, knocking him clear over his desk and onto the floor in a heap.

YODA
 (continuing) At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.

DARTH SIDIOUS flies through the air, cape flapping, heading toward the exit. At the last second, YODA flies into the exit and stops the Dark Lord.

YODA
 (continuing) If so powerful you are, why leave??

YODA ignites his lightsaber.

DARTH SlDIOUS
 You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.

DARTH SIDIOUS ignites his lightsaber.

YODA
 Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.

Their swords CLASH. The battle is extremely fast and furious.


 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

View screens EXPLODE around ANAKIN and OBI-WAN as they work their way into the Control Room. The fighting is intense. OBI-WAN is on the defensive as he jumps up on the table view screen in the center of the room.

ANAKIN
 Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side.

OBI-WAN
 I've heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I'd hear it from you.

ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN back into the Conference Room where the quarters are much closer. Sparks fly everywhere. ANAKIN jumps onto the conference table. OBI-WAN slides across the table, knocking ANAKIN over. OBI-WAN grabs ANAKIN’s lightsaber as he falls. OBI-WAN uses the Force to summon his dropped lightsaber. ANAKIN does the same.

 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT

PALPATINE seeks refuge in the vast Senate Chamber. He gets into the Chancellor's Podium and it starts to rise up into the Arena. YODA makes a giant leap into the control pod. The sword fighting is intense in the confined space.

 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

The battle intensifies.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) The flaw of power is arrogance.

OBI-WAN stands looking at his former apprentice for a moment.

ANAKIN
 You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lock sabers. OBI-WAN puts out his hand to use the Force to push ANAKIN away. ANAKIN puts out his hand to block OBI-WAN.
Both combatants are blasted backwards onto the control panels.
They regain their footing and the battle continues. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN away.
They battle around the room, and eventually the door to the exterior is knocked open. They continue battling out onto the balcony.

 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMRER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT

YODA unleashes a ferocious assault on PALPATINE, causing him to almost go over the edge. The Dark Lord drops his lightsaber but recovers with a BLAST OF ENERGY from his hands that surrounds YODA. YODA is deflecting the Sith Lord's lightning bolts.

The energy bolts begin to arc back on the Emperor. It looks as if the Dark Lord is doomed.

YODA
 Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy.

YODA jumps to a lower Senate Pod. PALPATINE reaches out with one hand, and a Senate pod is released from its mooring and heads toward the Podium. PALPATINE uses the Force to hurl pod after pod at YODA, who ducks and jumps from one flying pod to another.

YODA leaps away from the pods. He uses the Force to hold one pod suspended in the air. The pod spins and YODA throws it back at PALPATINE, who leaps away at the last moment.

YODA leaps after him, but PALPATINE quickly turns and aims the full force of his energy bolts at the tiny green Jedi, catching him in mid-air and throwing him back hard against the Podium. The force causes YODA to drop his lightsaber. YODA blocks the lightning and throws PALPATINE backwards off the podium. YODA is knocked off the Podium and falls several hundred feet to the base of the Podium. PALPATINE follows in his pod, searching for YODA.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY-DAY

ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN down a narrow balcony outside the Control Room. He rips objects off the wall and throws them at OBI-WAN as he pushes him further and further along the walkway.

The balcony ends, and OBI-WAN is trapped. He looks over the balcony and into a river of lava.

ANAKIN cuts apiece of the balcony railing off, along with a control panel.
ALARMS SOUND, and a protective ray shield around the superstructure disappears. It tumbles into the molten abyss, disappearing in a puff of smoke. A small pipe connects the Control Center to the Main Collection Plant. OBI-WAN has no choice but to tightrope-walk out across the lava river while fighting ANAKIN.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY, PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER, MAIN COLLECTION PLANT-DAY

ANAKIN, following OBI-WAN, jumps down onto the flexing pipe, lands, and resumes fighting.

 INT. MUSTAFAR-PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER-DAY

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN work their way across the small pipe, fighting ferociously as they go. OBI-WAN slips, throws his lightsaber up in the air, grabs on to the pipe, swings around, grabs on to an upper pipe, retrieves his lightsaber, and lands back on the original pipe. They continue to fight across the pipe until they reach the Main Collection Plant.

 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-WIRING CHUTE-NIGHT

YODA squishes his way through a mass of wires in a small chute. He talks on his comlink.

YODA
 Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

BAIL ORGANA
 (in speeder) There aren't many troops on this side. Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.

 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT

A Senate pod with COMMANDER THIRE () and SEVERAL OTHER CLONE TROOPERS climb up to where MAS AMEDDA and PALPATINE are waiting. Beneath the Main Podium, TWENTY CLONE TROOPERS search for Yoda 's body.

CLONE COMMANDER THIRE
 There is no sign of his body, sir.

MAS AMEDDA
 Then he is not dead.

PALPATINE
 Double your search.

CLONE COMMANDER THIRE
 Yes sir. Right away, sir.

PALPATINE
 (to Mas Amedda) Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.

MAS AMEDDA
 Yes, Master.

PALPATINE
 I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

PALPATINE walks into the Arena hallway. COMMANDER THIRE descends down to the floor of the Arena, where an intense search is taking place. SEVERAL CURIOUS SENATORS rubberneck in scattered pods.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN battle on the top of the multispired collection panels, jumping from one to the other. At the end of the collection cluster, a huge spray of lava covers the attachments that hold up the collectors. The frame begins to melt. It's raining lava. Both ANAKIN and OBI-WAN run for cover under the collection cluster. They continue to fight in the lava rain, darting from cover to attack, then quickly retreating to cover.
Support for the entire structure begins to fall away, and the collection cluster falls into the lava river. The Jedi continue their fight, climbing to the highest point on the tower as the rest begins to melt away as it rides the swift current down the river.

It bends toward the lava as they get out toward the end. The fighting gets fierce. OBI-WAN gets to the end and is trapped. The tower slowly starts to sink under the lava.

 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-NIGHT

BAIL ORGANA, in his open Cockpit Speeder, flies along next to the roof eave of the huge Senate Building. He slows and moves closer to a long row of recessed lights. Suddenly YODA falls out of one of the light recesses and lands in the Speeder. BAIL guns it and heads away from the Senate Building.

 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA'S SPEEDER-NIGHT

YODA straightens himself out.

YODA
 Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.

YODA and BAIL fly into the traffic of the city.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY

OBI-WAN realizes he is getting very close to the edge of the lava falls. He grabs a rope and leaps from the collection arm. ANAKIN follows.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their sword fight hanging from cables as they swing past each other.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY

C-PO carefully lifts PADME into his arms. R-D nervously looks on. BEEPING.

C-PO
 I am being careful. I've got a good hold on her, but . . . I'm worried about my back. I hope it's able to hold up under this weight.

C-PO carries PADME into the Naboo Skiff.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY

From their cables, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN both spot something that causes them to stop fighting. The lava river ahead drops off in a tremendous lava fall.

SNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the collector starts to break away and move toward the lava fall. OBI-WAN looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way toward the tower.

OBI-WAN does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating platform. He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the tower.

ANAKIN realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls. In the distance he sees some CONSTRUCTION DROIDS. He swings back to the tower, climbs up and makes a running leap and miraculously lands on A WORKER DROID. The DROID is confused and chatters to his CO-WORKER. The giant collector goes over the lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below.

OBI-WAN heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin's DROID is faster. He catches up with his old Master.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform.

OBI-WAN
 I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river.

ANAKIN
 I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .

OBI-WAN
 From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.

ANAKIN
 From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

OBI-WAN
 Well, then you are lost!

ANAKIN
 This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.

ANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN's platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.

OBI-WAN
 It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

ANAKIN
 You underestimate my power!

OBI-WAN
 Don't try it.

ANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava.

ANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.

OBI-WAN
 (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.

OBI-WAN picks up Anakin's light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.

ANAKIN
 I hate you!

OBI-WAN
 You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.

ANAKIN'S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.

 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY

OBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can't watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames.

He runs back to Padme's ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY

OBI-WAN makes his way to the SKIFF. He looks for Padme. THREEPIO sticks his head out the door of the SKIFF.

C-PO
 Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.

OBI-WAN runs on board the Naboo Skiff.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY

PADME lies on a cot or bed inside the ship. OBI-WAN walks over and checks on her.

PADME
 Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?

OBI-WAN looks at her sadly and does not answer. He brushes her hair back. Padme drops back into unconsciousness. ARTOO watches over her.
OBI-WAN rides in the co-pilot's station. He sits looking pensive. THREEPIO drives.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY

ANAKIN crawls up the bank, his body smoking. A shuttle flies overhead and lands.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-IMPERIAL SHUTTLE-DAY

An Imperial Shuttle closes its wings and settles on the highest of the Mustafar Landing Platforms. A PLATOON OF CLONE TROOPERS exits the craft, followed by DARTH SIDIOUS.

 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY

DARTH SIDIOUS walks in front of the CLONE TROOPERS on his way to get to Anakin at the edge of the lava pit.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAY

DARTH SIDIOUS discovers what remains of ANAKIN and checks him out. He turns to the CLONES.

DARTH SIDIOUS
 Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He's still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.

CLONE CAPTAIN
 Yes sir. Right away.

Several of the CLONES rush off as DARTH SIDlOUS puts his hand on ANAKIN's forehead.

 INT. POLIS MASSA-OBSERVATION DOME-NIGHT

On the isolated asteroid of Polis Massa, YODA meditates.

YODA
 Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...

QUI -GON
 (V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.

YODA
 Eternal consciousness.

QUI-GON
 (V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.

YODA
 . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.

QUI-GON
 (V.O.) You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.

YODA
 A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.

YODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the room and breaks his meditation.

BAIL ORGANA
 Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The CLONES have placed ANAKIN in a medical capsule. They float the wounded Sith Lord into the belly of the IMPERIAL CRUISER. DARTH SIDIOUS follows the capsule into the ship. The ship takes off.

 EXT. POLIS MASSA-LANDING PLATFORM-NIGHT

OBI-WAN lands the Naboo Cruiser on the landing platform of the isolated post of Polis Massa. YODA and BAIL ORGANA, along with a FEW GROUND CREW, are waiting as the ramp lowers and OBI-WAN emerges, carrying the unconscious PADME in his arms, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO.

BAIL ORGANA
 We'll take her to the medical center, quickly.

 EXT. LANDING PLATFORM-CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

The shuttle lands. DARTH SIDIOUS and CLONE TROOPERS leave the shuttle. ANAKIN's body is carried along in a floating medical capsule.

 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT

POLIS MEDICS work, on PADME in an operating theater. OBI-WAN and one of the MEDICAL DROIDS enter an observation room where BAIL and YODA are waiting.

MEDICAL DROID
 Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.

OBI-WAN
 She's dying?

MEDICAL DROID
 We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.

BAIL ORGANA
 Babies??!!

MEDICAL DROID
 She's carrying twins.

YODA
 Save them, we must. They are our last hope.

The MEDICAL DROID rushes back to the operating room. ARTOO and THREEPIO watch, greatly puzzled. ARTOO BEEPS.

C-PO
 It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.

 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN, in the medical capsule, is lifted onto a table in the Rehab Center. DROIDS go to work on him. ANAKIN has new legs and a new arm.

 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT

The TWINS are being delivered as BAIL ORGANA, YODA, ARTOO, and THREEPIO watch. OBI-WAN is in the operating theater with PADME. He takes her hand.

OBI-WAN
 Don't give up, Padme.

PADME winces from the pain. The MEDICAL DROID is holding the BABY.

MEDICAL DROID
 It's a boy.

PADME
 Luke . . .

PADME can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the baby on the forehead.

MEDICAL DROID
 ... and a girl.

PADME
 . . . Leia.

R-D, THREEPIO and BAIL ORGANA watch from an adjoining space.

 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

VADER, dressed in his black body armor, lies on the table. Nose plugs are inserted and the mask drops from above, sealing tightly. The helmet is fitted and VADER begins breathing.

 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT

OBI WAN leans over PADME and softly speaks to her.

OBI-WAN
 You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on.

PADME
 I can't . . .

PADME winces again and takes OBI-WAN's hand. She is holding Anakin's japor snippet.

OBI-WAN
 Save your energy.

PADME
 Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .

A last gasp, and she dies. Obi-Wan studies the necklace.

 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

DARTH SIDIOUS hovers around the periphery of a group of MEDICAL DROIDS who are working on ANAKIN. DARTH SIDIOUS paces in the foreground. A DROID approaches the Dark Lord.

MEDICAL DROID
 My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.

DARTH SIDIOUS
 Good. Good.

The DROID moves back to the table where DARTH VADER lies. The table begins to move upright. DARTH SIDIOUS moves in next to DARTH VADER.

DARTH SIDIOUS
 (continuing) Lord Vader, can you hear me?

DARTH VADER, with his dark mask and helmet, moves up into the frame until he is in a CLOSEUP.

DARTH VADER
 Yes, My Master.

DARTH VADER looks around the room.

DARTH VADER
 (continuing) Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?

DARTH SIDIOUS moves closer to the half droid/half man.

DARTH SIDIOUS
 I'm afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.

A LOW GROAN emanates from Vader's mask. Suddenly everything in the room begins to implode, including some of the DROIDS.

DARTH VADER
 I couldn't have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible! No!!!

VADER SCREAMS, breaks his bonds to the table, and steps forward, waving his hands, causing objects to fly around the room. SIDIOUS deflects the objects, but some of the DROIDS aren't so lucky. VADER'S PAINFUL SCREAMS echo throughout the Center.

 EXT. NABOO-ALDERAAN STARCRUISER

BAIL ORGANA's Starcruiser approaches the city of Theed.

 INT. ALDERAAN CRUISER-CONFERENCE ROOM

BAIL ORGANA, YODA, and OBI-WAN sit around a conference table.

YODA
 Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.

OBI-WAN
 We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.

YODA
 Split up, they should be.

BAIL ORGANA
 My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.

OBI-WAN
 And what of the boy?

YODA
 To Tatooine. To his family, send him.

OBI-WAN
 I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?

YODA
 Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will.

BAIL leaves the conference room. YODA stops OBI-WAN.

YODA
 (continuing) Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.

OBI-WAN
 Training??

YODA
 An old friend has learned the path to immortality.

OBI-WAN
 Who?

YODA
 One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

OBI-WAN
 Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?

YODA
 The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.

OBI-WAN
 I will be able to talk with him?

YODA
 How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.

 INT. ALDERAAN STARCRUISER-HALLWAY- SPACE

BAIL ORGANA, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO, approaches CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO CREW MEMBERS.

OBI-WAN rides up to the moisture farm homestead on an EOPIE. He dismounts, takes the BABY out of a papoose on his back, and walks toward AUNT BERU, who walks over to greet him. They talk for a moment, and OBI-WAN turns the baby over to the young homesteader. AUNT BERU walks to UNCLE OWEN who is standing on the ridge near the homestead. OBI-WAN leaves as OWEN, BERU, and the BABY watch the twin suns set.

IRIS OUT. END TITLES.
